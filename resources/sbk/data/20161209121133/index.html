      <p>Can we do philosophy using hypertext? What kind of work might a philosophical 
        hypertext do? Could it do argumentative work, or would any linear argument 
        be a subordinate part of some different hyperwork? But what is thinking 
        if not linear? In the course of this discussion I shall bring such questions 
        into the neighborhood of several philosophers for whom thinking is more 
        than a linear process.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Authors of familiar linear text work hard to create a convincing sequence 
        of narrative or exposition or argument. A hypertext by contrast comes 
        as a web of text, like a landscape that cannot be seen all at once but 
        can be explored along many different routes. The author cannot control 
        which links the reader will pursue, and in some systems the reader can 
        create new units and links, so that the web changes and grows. The roles 
        of author and reader begin to shift as the being of the text changes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Such multiply connected texts will be used in many ways. We do not know 
        what those ways will be. There is no reason to think there is one essential 
        or best way to use hypertext, any more than there is one essential or 
        best way to use paper. Writing on paper can produce laundry lists, thank-you 
        notes, scholarly treatises, disjointed jottings on the back of train schedules, 
        love letters, instruction manuals for VCRs, romance novels, and countless 
        other items whose points and criteria have little in common. We can imagine 
        how hypertext might help or alter activities that we already perform with 
        ordinary text, but it is harder to imagine what new forms of life or new 
        uses might develop (although we already know one, a new form of cooperative 
        writing).<br>
      </p>
      <p>Officially, according to Plato, philosophy's work involves the critical 
        self-observant search for the truth. But is critical dialogue and reading 
        a form of life or a part of other form(s) of life? In Plato, the activity 
        of philosophy leads us to discover who and where we are and how we should 
        live. In the process, Socrates tries to convince us that the search for 
        the truth is not merely a means but is itself a component of any good 
        human life that goes along with the grain of the universe. This larger 
        work of self (and communal) discovery (and creation) is an activity to 
        which we might imagine philosophical hypertext making a contribution.<br>
      </p>
      <p>There are some quite traditional functions that hypertext could perform 
        in philosophy:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, san-serif, Helvetica">It could 
          be used to emphasize the structure and outline of standard argumentative 
          essays (for instance, by equipping the essay with an overview or outline 
          whose links would take you to the relevant parts of the essay)</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, san-serif, Helvetica">It could 
          present a reference collection of philosophical texts that included 
          links from texts to commentaries, discussions, alternatives, refutations, 
          bibliographies, and the like.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, san-serif, Helvetica">Its links 
          could enhance editions of the collected writings of thinkers by making 
          connections that could not be found with standard search routines.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, san-serif, Helvetica">A jointly 
          composed active hypertext web could be a place where philosophical dialogue 
          (multilogue?) could happen. Because hypertext allows any lexia to be 
          'next to' any other, such a web would provide a very flexible medium 
          of discussion. (A <i>lexia</i> - the word is adapted from Roland Barthes 
          - is an individual unit of text in a hypertext.) Hypertext would allow 
          topics to be connected without forcing the writer-reader to decide under 
          which single heading the additional comment would be registered. It 
          would also enhance possibilities for textual reuse: what I posted would 
          not be erased but, besides arguing with me, you might make links that 
          grafted my statements into new contexts that made "my' texts work 
          very differently than I intended. This kind of philosophical hypertext 
          could be a powerful method of contesting or supplementing my claims.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Such implementations of hypertext are worthwhile and would enrich the 
        field of philosophy in many ways. Nonetheless, in these forms hypertext 
        still functions as a presentation medium that remains subservient to the 
        traditional goals and organization of philosophy. For the most part, links 
        would embody the standard moves of argumentation - making claims, giving 
        backing, contesting claims, raising questions, stating alternatives, and 
        so on. The text would be multilinear but would remain organized around 
        the familiar philosophical forms of linear argument.<br>
      </p>
      <p>There are more radical uses of hypertext. The most experimental so far 
        have been in fiction. There the narrative line is under attack. Could 
        there be a hypertext philosophy that departed from philosophy's argumentative 
        moves and traditional linear form?</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Garamond">The traditional nove l- . . . which Hegel called 
          "the epic of the middle-class world" - is perceived by its 
          would-be executioners as the virulent carrier of the patriarchal, colonial, 
          canonical, proprietary, hierarchical and authoritarian values of a past 
          that is no longer with us. Much of the novel's power is embedded in 
          the line, that compulsory author-directed movement from the beginning 
          of a sentence to its period, from the top of the page to the bottom, 
          from the first page to the last. Of course, through print's long history, 
          there have been countless strategies to counter the line's power ... 
          true freedom from the tyranny of the line is perceived as only really 
          possible now at last with the advent of hypertext ... where the line 
          in fact does not exist unless one invents and implants it in the text. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="right"><font size="2" face="Garamond">(Robert Coover, "The 
          End of Books," 23-25)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Could this also be true of philosophy? Is a nonlinear philosophical work 
        possible, or is philosophy so committed to the line that hypertext must 
        remain an expository device or an informational tool for philosophical 
        texts, unable to offer a brave world of new philosophical textual strategies?</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Garamond">No fixed centers, for starters - and no edges 
          either, no ends or boundaries. The ... line vanishes into a geographical 
          landscape or exitless maze, with beginnings, middles, ends being no 
          longer part of the immediate display. Instead: branching optional menus, 
          link markers and mapped networks. There are no hierarchies in these 
          topless (and bottomless) networks [of] evenly empowered and equally 
          ephemeral window-sized blocks of text and graphics. </font></p>
        <p align="right"><font size="2" face="Garamond">(Coover, 23)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Would such a writing be desirable in philosophy?</p>
      <p>On the one hand, philosophy, though it was born in the evenly empowered 
        fragments of the pre-Socratics, became self-conscious in the forward movement 
        of the Platonic dialogue. It declared its need of system and syllogism 
        with Aristotle and grew through the combative summae of the medievals 
        into the argumentative chains of Descartes and Spinoza, then it built 
        the great nineteenth-century systems and today shows itself most precisely 
        in the crafted linear form of the analytic article. It would seem that 
        there is no way to deny the line and still do philosophy. Hypertext appears 
        at best an informational convenience, but its shapeless depths must not 
        be allowed to weaken argumentative linearity, or philosophy will be reduced 
        to rhetoric.<br>
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Platonic dialogues are elusively inconclusive, 
        Aristotle's system is not intended to be deductively tight, there are 
        the forests of medieval commentaries on commentaries, the nineteenth-century 
        systems are disturbingly nonlinear, and there are counter-traditions attacking 
        or perverting the line from at least Pascal and through Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, 
        Wittgenstein, and today's deconstructionists. While current philosophy 
        appears mostly as the essay or the anthology, there have also been the 
        meditation, the aphorism, the pensée, the diary, the dialogue, 
        and other forms. So perhaps hypertext will make a new kind of philosophical 
        writing possible.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is an odd question to ask: "What can hypertext do to and for 
        philosophy?" It is like asking what print can do. But there are some 
        generalities that were observed, as early as Plato, about the effect of 
        writing on communication, memory, and thought. Writing is the first step 
        in thought's losing control and gaining control of itself: losing control 
        because, as Plato complains, writing removes the content from the living 
        process of dialogue that should be fully present and responsible to itself; 
        gaining control because the units of exchange can be frozen and inspected 
        and structured more intricately, just as Plato wrote and rewrote his dialogues; 
        yet again losing control, because even with that rewriting the words and 
        structures take on lives of their own. They do so in oral discussion too, 
        but in hypertext words and structures can find their way into more contexts 
        and changes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Philosophy is in many ways a child of writing. There are few if any oral 
        texts that might be technical philosophy. (The Indian Vedanta sutras come 
        to mind, with their lapidary conciseness fit for memorization, but they 
        soon become embedded within a cloud of written commentary.) There are 
        many oral texts that might do some of the things philosophy does, but 
        the specific philosophical gesture seems to want writing, to preserve 
        lines for future examination.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Philosophy has always exhibited some tension between writing and live 
        performance. Socrates wrote nothing. Plato writes condemning writing. 
        Medieval teaching consisted of oral commentaries and debates on written 
        texts. Jewish and Tibetan philosophical practices weave an intricate interplay 
        of written and oral performance. Even professionalized philosophy today 
        usually judges contemporary thinkers on oral quickness as well as on written 
        depth.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I have assembled here some considerations that urge against philosophy's 
        using hypertext as more than an expository device. They are based on a 
        classical conception of philosophy and make a strong case that philosophy 
        cannot lose its line, which I almost believe is so. This argument is then 
        subjected to qualifications derived from several thinkers who question 
        or supplement the line.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The principal argument against web writing in philosophy is straightforward: 
        philosophy essentially involves argument, and argument essentially involves 
        a beginning, middle, and end, so that a truly philosophical text needs 
        a line. This position claims more than that works of philosophy should 
        include arguments within their texture; it says that any single work should 
        be structured as a large argument. It is through the argumentative line 
        of its overall structure that any piece of philosophical writing does 
        its work.<br>
      </p>
      <p>An argument links premises and conclusion. To use the hackneyed example, 
        from "All men are mortal" and 'Socrates is a man" we must 
        conclude that "Socrates is mortal." This is not reversible, 
        since from "Socrates is mortal" and 'Socrates is a man" 
        we cannot conclude that "All men are mortal." There is a structure 
        to the argument that must be respected. The three sentences could be linked 
        in a hypertext web, but that is not enough to give the unidirectional 
        dependence demanded by argumentative structure.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is true that for expository convenience the parts of the argument 
        may come in any order in the text, but the argument will be present only 
        when the underlying linear abstract structure is indicated in some manner. 
        It is also true that some arguments have multiple beginnings and branches 
        that jointly support conclusions or diverge from premises, but these still 
        arrange into a unidirectional abstract structure with beginnings, middles, 
        and ends. A philosophical argument (or a mathematical proof) cannot be 
        presented as a cloud of disjointed statements. The conclusion is that 
        philosophy's line cannot be dissolved in the way some have dreamed of 
        dissolving the narrative line. On this view bypertext would have to respect 
        the line by making arguments the units of presentation and by maintaining 
        some overall linear argumentative structure.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This amounts to a claim that philosophy loses its identity if it is not 
        structured as an argument. This essentialist claim can be further developed: 
        in a hypertext web without a line there would be no overall structure 
        that would enable one to hold the text still and locate the claims being 
        made, in order to have a clear object to criticize. In introductory philosophy 
        courses students are often told that the first thing they should do is 
        "find the conclusion." Then they are told to "outline the 
        argument." Since an outline contains constant indications of its 
        structure, one knows one's location at all times. One needs to know where 
        one is in the larger structure, so that one can see what is being claimed 
        and be able to criticize it. The line brings focus, and focused criticism 
        is essential to philosophy, one of whose parents was Socrates's insistence 
        on responsible, limited assent to carefully defined claims.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This emphasis upon linear argument contrasts with hypertext webs that 
        may have no fixed beginnings or endings, are hard to explore, may have 
        no conclusions, and may deliberately avoid being caught in any totalizing 
        overview. So, to do hypertext philosophy without the line that leads to 
        a conclusion would seem to denature philosophy into its traditional opposites, 
        rhetoric or idle talk.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Rhetoric: the hypertext would perhaps be an accumulation of words and 
        images and considerations that persuade the reader to adopt an attitude 
        or a course of action, but this persuasive effect would not be controlled 
        by a line that provides a route for criticism and rational evaluation 
        in terms of the goal of truth rather than the goal of persuasion. (It 
        is true that there are modes of philosophy that attack the distinction 
        between philosophy and rhetoric, but these usually do so as the conclusion 
        of an argument that does conventional philosophical work.)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Idle talk: the hypertext would just expand as conversation might, enjoying 
        the act but not standing watch over itself by asking about conclusions 
        and grounds. Socrates tried to convert his listeners and bring them into 
        the position of constant responsibility for their own and others' discourse. 
        Conversation can be its own pleasure and work within a complex network 
        of changing goals and its own logic of response, but Socrates wants philosophy 
        to be single-minded, subordinating discourse to the single search for 
        grounds and truth. From Plato on, philosophy has insisted on the need 
        for decisions in its root meaning of cutting off what it takes to be wandering 
        excess and keeping to the narrow path. Socrates tends to picture our usual 
        conversations as either goalless pleasurable exchange or manipulative 
        rhetoric; he seeks to turn all conversations into occasions for teaching 
        and responsibility. (We might suspect that a philosophical hypertext would 
        have to find ways to let discourse overflow this strict goal-orientation 
        while remaining self-critical and responsive.)<br>
      </p>
      <p>The previous consideration can be amplified in a more practical way. 
        There is a danger that creating a philosophy hypertext web would be the 
        functional equivalent of writing without self-discipline, publishing one's 
        drafts and jottings, or self-indulgently exfoliating ideas without taking 
        a position. This extravagance would infect the philosophical work with 
        some well-known diseases: wandering commentary, endless qualifications, 
        fruitless self-reflection, unnecessary contentiousness, the piling up 
        of meta-level upon meta-level. This result could both stem from and itself 
        promote intellectual laziness, or it could cater to a noncritical audience 
        that wants to be titillated by the passage of ideas but not challenged 
        in its own beliefs of values.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The obvious response to this third consideration is that bad writing 
        is bad writing, whether it is in hypertext or linear text. But the consideration 
        suggests that working up one's drafts and jottings into good philosophical 
        writing is precisely a matter of critical mastery and judgment that demand 
        and produce a line. What would thinking mean if it were not providing 
        form and focus, definite claims, critical judgment, beginnings, middles, 
        and ends, and so preventing an indefinite accumulation of words and images? 
        This question remains open.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A classical answer to these classical considerations might be to grant 
        that philosophy needs the argumentative line but to deny that a philosophical 
        hypertext web need be limited to one single line. Hypertext philosophy 
        should be considered not as a single author controlling a line into a 
        text but as a net of linear texts confronting one another in a kind of 
        endless expansion, as they have in fact done in the history of philosophy. 
        But this response provides only a weak defense of philosophical hypertext, 
        for we already have that open web of interacting texts - it is the library, 
        and it contains its own links and internal maps in its commentaries, concordances, 
        bibliographies, and footnotes. The links in a hypertext library would 
        make possible many new types of commentaries and collections, but these 
        new features might still allow individual units to remain structured in 
        linear ways.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Can hypertext webs provide new possibilities for writing something that 
        might be less linear or nonlinear and yet still do philosophical work? 
        If the above considerations are accepted, it would appear that philosophy 
        is constituted by the presence of the line. But even if the line is required, 
        it may not necessarily be the single controlling element in philosophical 
        writing. Not all paths follow the line.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Philosophy's line finds itself constantly surrounded by supplements which 
        it both desires and rejects: marginalia (as in medieval manuscripts), 
        parallel columns of text (as in Kant's antinomies), parenthetical (and 
        footnote) remarks that provide self-critical comments, ampliative material, 
        methodological reflections, objections and replies, ironic juxtapositions, 
        historical precedents and deviations, references to other texts, quotations, 
        and so on.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Footnotes are said to be a kind of primitive hypertext, but there is 
        one important difference. At least in books where footnotes actually appear 
        at the foot of the page, the note and the text it comments on are present 
        together. The note and text form one visual gestalt. (In hypertext systems 
        this gestalt can happen only if more than one window can be presented 
        on screen simultaneously, but even then the windowing apparatus separates 
        them.) Another example of the same problem is James Joyce's work. <i>Finnegans 
        Wake</i> in particular is sometimes cited as a proto-hypertext. But this 
        is misleading; Joyce's work depends on the simultaneity and the emerging 
        together of the multilingual play of meanings and structures. Separated 
        into discrete links, the combinations would lose much of their power.</p>
      <p>Plato's dialogues are notorious for their sinuous movement and their 
        pauses to talk about themselves, and Aristotle's texts are full of remarks 
        that beg for links to other discussions. Writing philosophy, one feels 
        a constant tension between the desire to reach out into the surrounding 
        discourse that opens a place for the line, and the reverse desire for 
        compactness and linearity. Philosophy wants to cover everything with its 
        graffiti, to find itself always already arrived, but also to utter only 
        the one first magic necessary word.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We can insist on the linear nature of argument, but in what is argument 
        embedded? There is a knowing how to go on which is knowing how to read 
        how to continue the series, how to use the tool. This knowing is a matter 
        of finding ourselves accepting descriptions, of knowing what sort of place 
        "we" are in. This place is not established by argument; it is 
        presupposed in being able to follow an argument.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The classical philosophical dream is that philosophy as a whole be one 
        huge rigorous discourse, which usually means one huge chain of arguments. 
        But where is the chain anchored (and how do we know what it is to follow 
        it)? Aristotle said (in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>) that either a 
        chain of argument has to be anchored in premises that are evident in themselves 
        and so do not need argument (the choice of Aristotle and Descartes and 
        many today) or the chain must be circular (in complex ways, the choice 
        of Hegel and of today's holists). Either way, the big argument should 
        dominate the overall structure of any text in which it appears.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In fact, it is preparations for the big argument that often dominate 
        the texts. Arguments, big or small, are surrounded by a more informal 
        discourse that leads us to and from the argument. This discourse puts 
        us in a position to follow the line. There are discourses that get us 
        into position to accept the premises, to understand the situation, to 
        follow the argument, to tie the line into life.<br>
      </p>
      <p>For many philosophers the austerity of the mathematical proof stands 
        as the ideal, yet, as Kant pointed out, philosophy and mathematics are 
        crucially different in that mathematics starts with definitions while 
        philosophy ends with them.3 Philosophy discusses alternative first principles 
        and disputes definitions and modes of argument. It tries to find a rigorous 
        way of disclosing the conditions that make rigorous lines possible.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Even the purest philosophical line in a technical article or book has 
        vestigial or presupposed discourses of this type surrounding it. They 
        furnish the understanding of what the piece is and what to do with it. 
        The real structure of the philosophical work is not simply argumentative. 
        To read philosophy as always embedded in such informal discourse demands 
        that one pay attention to parts of the text students are encouraged to 
        rush over in their eagerness to find the conclusion and outline the argument. 
        A more circumspect mode of reading does not make such essentialist presuppositions.<br>
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand we have to be careful not to make the parallel mistake 
        of saying that the fluid discourse is itself totally without argumentative 
        structure. The point should be that argument and fluidity are always linked. 
        Just as we cannot say that argument absorbs the fluid discourse, so we 
        cannot say that the surrounding discourse is primary in the sense that 
        it has some special nonargumentative structure of its own.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So, the argumentative line is surrounded by a fluid discourse in which 
        there are no fixed primacies and no firm meta-levels, because in that 
        discourse such things get established, though in an always discussable 
        manner. Which is not to say that the fluid discourse never accomplishes 
        anything; bearings are given. Hypertext seems to be a medium in which 
        this fluid discourse could flourish.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I see two matching temptations here: the first, to dismiss the embedding 
        discourse as preparation, a ladder to be thrown away once we have climbed 
        it; the second, to make that discourse into a new kind of line. Hypertext 
        is not likely to give in to the first temptation, but we can learn something 
        about the possibilities of hypertext philosophy from someone who gave 
        in to the second, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. It may seem surprising 
        to invoke the great systematizer here, but there is a lesson we can learn 
        from him, and a caution.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The lesson is the possibility of two-dimensional philosophical discourse, 
        where the links do multiple duty. Hegel's books appear to be resolutely 
        linear treatments of a sequence of many detailed categories and historical 
        periods. But that movement has a peculiar structure: the transition from 
        one category to another turns out to be an aspect of a larger transition, 
        which turns out to be a moment in a yet larger movement, and so on up 
        to the major movement of the system, which takes the form of a circle, 
        not of a line with a beginning and end.<br>
      </p>
      <p>For example, in Hegel's political philosophy a particular detailed transition, 
        say, between two parts of property law or two aspects of the division 
        of labor, also expresses part of a larger movement by which the bourgeois 
        social structure defines itself, which in turn acts as a phase in still 
        larger movements concerning the embodying of freedom, the relation of 
        history and social identity, and the coming of self-understanding of our 
        place in the world process. These larger movements do not just sum up 
        a series of micro-movements; there are complex mutual influences among 
        the levels. There is no single micro-transition to which one can point 
        and say that there and nowhere else the larger movement is accomplished.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In pointing out relations between aspects of property law or kinds of 
        religious symbols, Hegel means to show how they derive their identity 
        from their relation to each other but also how that relation in turn depends 
        for its identity and stability on its insertion in a larger exchange, 
        and so on. The links found in Hegel's texts work on many levels at once, 
        performing different movements at different paces.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, at none of these levels do the links function as moves in 
        standard arguments. Argumentation does occur, but it is subordinated to 
        Hegel's attempt to capture and arrange into an interdependent whole the 
        set of contexts and categories that are the preconditions of argument. 
        Hegel's ambition is to show how all the situations (and directions and 
        self-understandings and categories of thought) that set the place of argument 
        can be grasped as moving towards a final communal self-understanding.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However one questions such grandiose ambition, Hegel's approach offers 
        two lessons for our hypertext theme. The first is that philosophy can 
        indeed be made out of a discussion of the place and preconditions of argument's 
        line. Such philosophy need not itself proceed as a big linear argument, 
        though it may use argument within its own movement. Secondly, links and 
        transitions may have other forms than the standard argumentative moves, 
        and they may be elements in many motions at the same time.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Here, however, is the caution. Hegel tries to show complex relations 
        of mutual constitution and interdependence among the categories that structure 
        thought., Those relations do not fit easily into linear arguments, but 
        neither do they fit the relations usually said to connect units of a hypertext.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Hypertext is often diagrammed as boxes connected by arrows. In <i>The 
        Science of Logic</i>, Hegel complained about the geometric or numerical 
        diagrams employed in his day to model the relations among thoughts. Such 
        diagrams, he said, showed too few types of relations (inclusion, exclusion, 
        and one- or two-way relation). Moreover, he objected, they presupposed 
        that the items being related were distinct and already definite at either 
        end of the diagram's lines. Such diagrams cannot easily show the mutual 
        dependencies and co-constitution among our categories of thought; they 
        tend to reduce these relations to inclusion-exclusion or whole-and-part. 
        The caution, then, is that hypertext may make its lexias too independent 
        and its relations too geometric to allow the complex interdependencies 
        that nonlinear philosophy might want to explorers</p>
      <p>Peter Whalley discusses this issue in connection with the standard comparison 
        of linear text and hypertext:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Garamond">It is a mistake to think of conventional texts, 
          and particularly expository teaching texts, as being purely linear. 
          Text linguists ... have shown how, under a superficially linear form, 
          authors may create rich, complex relational structures. It could even 
          be argued that the simple pointer and hierarchical structures provided 
          in hypertext are semantically more limiting than the implicit relationships 
          created in conventional materials ... [in which] cycles of ideas are 
          repeated and overlaid upon each other. For example a central idea may 
          be repeated within progressively more complex contexts. The skillful 
          author may use the linear text form to weave an entirely nonlinear pattern 
          of associations in the reader's mind.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Can hypertext display the process of first expounding an idea as independent 
        or immediately given then showing it to be involved in complex relations 
        that qualify its independence and constitute a larger unity? This overcomes 
        the seeming independence of the first stage, then returns to that stage, 
        now in the new context. Though not taking the form of linear argument, 
        this process would demand a set of links that would do multiple duty, 
        and it should be traversed from a beginning and return again to that beginning. 
        To intercept only a part of this movement would be to take as independent 
        something that should not stand on its own. To leave the first links behind 
        would be to miss an aspect of how the larger unit exists. To lose the 
        cyclic or spiral movement in a cloud of links would be to diffuse the 
        investigation into comments that presuppose too much independence in the 
        individual moments of the discourse.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Efforts to avoid these problems might demand that individual lexias be 
        very large, which would reintroduce linear texts, or that new forms and 
        uses of links be found. But can the box-and-arrow structure of lexias 
        and links carry a progress of thought that, while it is neither argumentative 
        nor linear, does demand mutual movement of this kind?<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is easy to add qualifications to what you find in a hypertext, but 
        the model that dominates hypertext's mechanism is that of independent 
        bits of information linked to one another. Yet, the fluid discourse that 
        shows that philosophy is not all linear argument also demands more kinds 
        of structure than arbitrarily multiplied links. Connection and linkage 
        are not the same as dialectical relations or mutual constitution. Hypertext's 
        granularity makes it difficult to show two units co-constituting each 
        other. We need a new nonargumentative form for a set of links, above the 
        level of the individual lexia and short of the entire hypertext network. 
        The possibility of new philosophical writing depends in large measure 
        on the creation of such intermediate forms of movement and linkage that 
        make more than argumentative moves.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, in an interactive hypertext such intermediate forms would 
        remain porous and interruptible. They would be at most one set of paths. 
        (If a form is unable to be framed, is it still a form?) Putting the issue 
        this way reminds us that problems about the multiple and porous boundaries 
        of forms have long been debated in the philosophy of art and literature, 
        in which theorists have had to deal with reuse dominating or covering 
        original use (as in reference to and quotation from obscure originals) 
        or in which original unities are dispersed into new artistic forms and 
        genres.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Does this then mean that hypertext might be best thought about not by 
        means of images of great systems but with Derrida's deconstruction, which 
        is an errant descendant of Hegel's dialectic that glories in incomplete 
        wholes and interrupted necessities? Deconstruction emphasizes the lack 
        of totality and closure in any form. The line tends to become encrusted 
        with its preconditions and with meta-comments and amplifications. Suppose 
        it dissolved into them? Imagine a text that became nothing but footnotes 
        and marginalia referring to one another. (It sometimes seems that contemporary 
        deconstructive texts aspire to this status.) This text would say many 
        things at once without granting primacy to any of them. Could this text 
        still be philosophy?<br>
      </p>
      <p>In any case, deconstructive alarms should have been going off during 
        the earlier discussion. I deliberately used the word <i>supplement</i> 
        - and <i>essence</i>, <i>unity</i>, <i>necessary boundaries</i>, <i>fixed 
        identity</i>, <i>full presence</i>, <i>excess</i>: these are all fighting 
        words nowadays. I am not here interested in what is sometimes called deconstruction 
        but is really an attempt to eliminate any notion of essence and identity. 
        Rather, what interests me is the maneuver of allowing essences, identities, 
        boundaries (and argumentative lines and definite claims) while showing 
        how the claimed essences or unities break their own closure. They function, 
        but they function as effects in a space they cannot dominate.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Hypertext looks like a natural for the attempt to show that any presumed 
        overall structure, narrative or philosophical, argumentative or dialectical, 
        works within a larger field that it does not control. Hypertext's endless 
        possibilities for recombination and reuse should facilitate the creation 
        of texts in which the narrative or philosophical line is self-consciously 
        reinscribed within, yet does not dominate, the space of the text.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In his book <i>Hypertext</i>, George P. Landow has shown many parallels 
        between contemporary literary theory and hypertext technology. He is particularly 
        concerned with the overall effect of hypertext as a medium; he argues 
        that it will question the unity of the text, the roles of reader and author, 
        and the power relations of education and access to information. He concedes 
        that "the enumerating linear rhetoric of 'first, second, third' so 
        well suited to print will continue to appear within individual blocks 
        of text," but he argues that the whole will not be structured in 
        a linear fashion. Landow's examples from classroom experience show how 
        a more active hypertext creates pressure on textual unity and traditional 
        roles.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It might seem that Derrida's experiments with parallel columns of text, 
        marginalia, and footnotes that bite the text that feeds them could be 
        read as print substitutes for hypertext, but most of Derrida's deconstructive 
        performances happen in linear text that is made to exceed its own strictures 
        without typographical gymnastics. There are indeed texts with distorted 
        linearity, for instance the book <i>Glas</i> or the essay "Tympan," 
        but something is going on in these texts that could not be duplicated 
        in hypertext links. Derrida's typographical maneuvers depend on simultaneous 
        visual access to the related elements. It is important in those texts 
        that the references across the parallel columns be contingent, dependent 
        on how the eye jumps and reads, rather than frozen in the discrete predetermined 
        links of a hypertext. It is the contingency of juxtaposition, rather than 
        the definite link, that helps demonstrate the fecundity of signs and lack 
        of closure Derrida is concerned to show.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, in some ways hypertext does not question the unity of the text 
        deeply enough. It might seem to a deconstructive eye that hypertext remains 
        too much a system of linked presences rather than a play of presence and 
        absence. Even if it is growing and cannot be summarized in a glance, it 
        exists as a totality of nodes and links, a vast structure that could in 
        principle be made present. This statement is not quite accurate, however. 
        Although there is a totality to be found in the computer records, the 
        "form" of the hypertext is not in the enumeration of nodes and 
        links but in their more complex relations. Pointing to the set of pages 
        in a book or the letters on a page does not tell you whether the book 
        is a novel or a repair manual, or whether the letters are an introduction, 
        a narration, or enact some other intermediate part of a larger book-form. 
        Listing the totality of nodes and links in a hypertext does not tell you 
        what they are doing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The fact that links are possible challenges the closure of any piece 
        of text. Still, the very endlessness of possible links means that none 
        of them need question the integrity of the individual lexia in the way 
        that deconstructive operations conducted on site might do. Links lack 
        the contingent fecundity of immediate juxtaposition and the self-referentiality 
        of clever textual turns. The links do not necessarily bring off the fragile 
        slippage of a signification that denies its own attempted closure. Hypertext 
        links can change a lexia's relations and its role within a whole or context 
        but they do not make it reflect on or exceed its own unity. One could 
        presumably compose the individual lexias so that they did this self-questioning 
        or self-transgressing, but then what would the hypertext mechanism add 
        to the deconstructive endeavor? It remains to be seen whether hypertext 
        can put enough deconstructive pressure on the individual lexia. There 
        is the danger that the hypertext could become a mass of comments and links 
        in which no single link could gather enough force or distinctiveness to 
        make deconstructive maneuvers. By their very multitude the links would 
        allow individual lexias too much atomistic sufficiency. This returns us 
        to the issue of intermediate form.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We need to understand better the ways in which links and paths can enact 
        forms and figures (intermediate between the lexia and the whole document) 
        that bring pressure to bear on the "internal" being of the individual 
        lexias. We need to understand how to write the individual lexias so that 
        they are more clearly permeable to this influence.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We might also ask whether a hypertext web might expand too far to maintain 
        the pressure on textual unity and authorial roles. A map that is too detailed 
        becomes another nature to be explored. An expanding hypertext web would 
        contain so many kinds of paths that it could not be classifiable as belonging 
        to a single genre, such as philosophy or fiction. Those regions of the 
        web that were genre-similar would be inscribed into a textual space that 
        was not controlled by the rules of their genre. It is an exciting possibility. 
        But as the web became larger it might, like a library, appear only as 
        a background for unified works in various genres. We are concerned here 
        not with such a global library but with the philosophical reading room 
        (even if its walls are porous). An analogous problem emerges there as 
        well. A multiply created philosophical hypertext web (or region of a web) 
        could get large enough that it would resemble a collection of philosophical 
        journal articles responding to one another, or the threads of discussion 
        carried on Internet electronic-mail lists. But then the hypertext might 
        become only a presentation medium for a collection of linear texts. This 
        argument again points to the importance of new intermediate forms other 
        than argument and counter-argument.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I keep stressing the need for new intermediate forms because we must 
        avoid the temptation of seeing hypertext either as a collection of atomistic 
        information units or as an infinite play of signifiers. It is true that 
        hypertext's writing space cannot be restricted by any intermediate forms 
        that might be enacted within it. This lack of restrictability can lead 
        to viewing the hypertext web as itself that general economy that lies 
        behind and within any limited text or economy. This temptation is fueled 
        by dreams of a universal hypertext network. But no matter how extensive, 
        a hypertext web remains an artifact with defined components and links. 
        The unlimited economy or general text cannot be made present, for the 
        act of making present is the creation of a limited economy. The general 
        economy can be indicated only indirectly, because although it is a condition 
        of the possibility of any defined signifier or network, it does not exist 
        in the usual sense as an encounterable signifier or network. Some writers 
        who have been inspired by deconstruction want to liberate us from limitations 
        by instituting the general economy in writing or in community, and they 
        seek institutions or ways of writing that will do the job. But I take 
        deconstruction to be as much about the impossibility of such instauration 
        as about the impossibility of a completely closed text. Nonetheless, a 
        hypertext web can in its way be a strong symbol of the unlimited fecundity 
        of signs, of the varied individuation of texts and entities, and of the 
        endlessness of redescription and reincorporation.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So, after passing by Hegel and Derrida, what can we say about possible 
        new forms of philosophical writing? In our (post)modern world we are gradually 
        trying to create social and political forms that have neither atomic indivisible 
        units nor totalizing structures. These forms, temporary and permeable 
        as they may be, still provide space that we are painfully learning to 
        inhabit without demanding fixity and closure. If there is to be a philosophical 
        writing in hypertext, it needs such forms. The forms will take advantage 
        of the nonlinear characteristics of the hypertext medium. We do not yet 
        know what these forms will be, but they will be in the links.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Putting the matter this way misleads, because it still suggests a neat 
        hierarchy of forms. In a written text, the letters of the alphabet are 
        distinct and relatively stable; attempts to show the play of unity and 
        disunity in a text do not (normally) need to question the identity of 
        the letters that compose it. The form of the text is in the paragraphs 
        and sections. So, too, the form of the hypertext will be in the links 
        and paths, not the individual units. This may be true, but the analogy 
        of letters is far from exact. In printed books (as opposed to illuminated 
        manuscripts) there is little feedback (except some aesthetic judgment) 
        between the overall form of an essay or book and the form of the letters 
        of which it is composed. In a hypertext, the individual units, being themselves 
        already quite complex, could be so influenced by feedback from the larger 
        forms that it would be difficult to speak of a hierarchy of levels. This 
        interplay is one reason it may be better to speak of new figures of discourse 
        rather than new forms. "The task that confronts us as writers in 
        the new medium is precisely to discover effective new figures."<br>
      </p>
      <p>One could object that hypertext makes closed works impossible, so we 
        should not worry about their forms and figures, as if they could be viewed 
        as closed wholes. But this also is misleading. Hypertext does make totally 
        closed works impossible. New links can move in and reuse pieces of my 
        writing, but whatever form I gave my writing remains available. It cannot 
        dominate the hypertext space and it cannot claim to totalize the meaning 
        and role of the individual lexias, but it remains followable. Otherwise 
        the hypertext would have no structure. Were this the case, the text would 
        resemble a modern society that at times seems to have no intermediate 
        structures between the individual and the global state or economy, and 
        the text would be similarly oppressive. Intermediate figuration creates 
        open space.<br>
      </p>
      <p>One could also object that my attempt to find a new form of philosophical 
        writing is misguided, for the old genres will not be able to maintain 
        their boundaries in hypertext. But boundaries are not erased by hypertext; 
        they are made permeable. Form and genre lose their presumed absoluteness 
        in hyperspace, but they do not dissolve into atomized text or bland mixtures. 
        Rather, they stand in tension with other uses and other partial wholes. 
        We have to learn from Hegel and Derrida that the choice is not between 
        rigid boundaries and total flux.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I have been asking about philosophical hypertext works that are not libraries 
        of articles or threads of discussion and argument. The latter are legitimate 
        and straightforward uses of hypertext in philosophy, but they do not address 
        the question I have been pursuing, which is whether there can be nonlinear 
        philosophical works that may include argumentative lines as part of a 
        different texture that takes advantage of the peculiar potentials of the 
        hypertext medium.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Such new forms may come about through what appears to be a more disjointed 
        style of writing, one that is less architectural than linear text. Architecture 
        has traditionally implied hierarchical structure. Designing a traditional 
        building involves intricate adjustments of part to part, so that the building 
        will stand successfully, but also so that it will have a unified effect 
        and the many demands of the program will be harmoniously accommodated. 
        Adjustments to the height of the windows or the width of a room cause 
        compensating changes elsewhere in the structure. Writing texts with an 
        architecture also involves intricate adjustments of part to part. Changes 
        made in one place ripple through the whole structure, so that the whole 
        has a conclusion, a unity of effect and tone, and so that any disunity 
        is purposive and functional.<br>
      </p>
      <p>One could design a building against architecture, perhaps with parts 
        that became relatively independent, that could change without causing 
        balancing changes in other parts. Text could be written like that, with 
        parts that remained outside of other parts, in an assemblage that did 
        not demand balanced unity, wherein changes in one place did not necessarily 
        demand changes elsewhere. Because of its modular nature hypertext will 
        tend to this kind of writing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But a building made of fragments still has to be carefully designed; 
        random assemblages soon lose their ability to hold our interest. So, too, 
        hypertext needs some form and figure more than simple addition. Flipping 
        the channels on cable television can produce exciting juxtapositions, 
        but only for a while. Active reading becomes passive titillation. Later 
        it becomes noise. We need forms of hypertext writing that are neither 
        standard linear hierarchical unities nor the cloying shocks of simple 
        juxtaposition.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Would such a writing still be philosophy? To some extent such a question 
        is unanswerable, since the criteria for what counts as philosophy evolve 
        over time. But recalling the earlier discussion of Socrates and the arguments 
        about argument, one can perhaps require that to be called philosophy the 
        writing maintain something of the Socratic watchfulness over itself and 
        the abstract or conceptual structures it employs, and that it be responsible 
        in the claims it makes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Can a philosophical hypertext make claims? Since there would be no one 
        ending point to which it all comes, there might not be one set of propositions 
        that are the focal point of the text. There are many readings with their 
        endings determined in part by the reader. A reading may end with the reader 
        feeling that a claim has been made on her. But does a claim have to be 
        the demand to affirm a proposition?<br>
      </p>
      <p>In a single-author work certain propositions might run through the text 
        the way themes run through a song, so that the reader must encounter them. 
        The author could structure the text so that the reader constantly returned 
        to certain claims, but this structuring would not necessarily make these 
        claims 'the" conclusion. Reading a philosophical text might gradually 
        reveal an intricate abstract structure, just as hypertext fiction can 
        gradually reveal a plot, a situation, or a set of characters even if not 
        read in a unique linear fashion. The revealed abstract structure could 
        take the form of one or more arguments, a network of concepts, or a conceptual 
        landscape.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This form of structure would become difficult, however, in the case of 
        interactive or cooperative hypertext. Multiple authors might work by argument 
        and counter-argument focused on a set of claims, but they might not: they 
        might work by forming and re-forming the text. They could create multiple 
        paths and multiple structures without necessarily focusing on any single 
        set of propositions or without revealing any one landscape. In such cases 
        no particular propositional claims or abstract structures would remain 
        central, yet the multiple and interacting structures would not be simply 
        diverse from one another and could still form one work, albeit with a 
        new kind of unity doing a new kind of work. Of course, what I have just 
        described as possible in the case of interactive hypertext is also possible 
        in the case of a single author.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What kind of work could such hypertexts accomplish? A text can still 
        make a claim on you even if it does not support a particular proposition 
        or present a particular abstract structure of argument. The text could 
        claim your acknowledgment (for example, that this question or option is 
        live, that this is who you are, that this is where we live, that these 
        are connected, that there are more possibilities here than you thought, 
        or that something you wanted to do or say is impossible), or make connections 
        (giving "takes" on a subject, evoking atmosphere, exploring 
        a landscape). Is a net of connections a claim? A suit to try on? A terrain 
        to explore? Claims need not be single propositions within argumentative 
        lines. They can be demonstrated in more ways than by argument. I can demonstrate 
        a machine, a technique, a concept, by showing it in action. Exploration 
        can claim territory, making us acknowledge that more lies beyond that 
        horizon or convincing us that there is no gold in those particular hills. 
        These acknowledgments we may report to ourselves with a proposition, but 
        the text may not focus on stating or supporting that proposition.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is significant that, even after centuries, dispute continues about 
        what claims are made by the most classic of philosophy texts. The enduring 
        significance of the works of Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel does not 
        rest on our ability to locate their claims definitively but on the works' 
        having opened up new territory for thought. Questions outlast the answers 
        with which they first came, and hypertext is very good for asking questions.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We have some examples of new philosophical forms. From the last century, 
        we have Friedrich Nietzsche's books of aphorisms and Sören Kierkegaard's 
        multiple voices and mixed genres. Among more recent writers, Stanley Cavell's 
        finely crafted yet digressive essays can suggest new kinds of path. The 
        movement of his writing derives from J. L. Austin's tentative essays and 
        from Ludwig Wittgenstein, who spoke of his own writing as criss-crossing 
        a landscape.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Nietzsche may seem to be appearing rather late in this discussion, since 
        his works proclaimed a new mode of fragmentary, questioning philosophy, 
        but it is too easy to draw the wrong lessons from Nietzsche. It was useful 
        first to visit Hegel and raise issues about how one lexia might qualify 
        another and about how concepts may depend on one another in ways that 
        are different from standard hypertext relations. It was useful to see 
        Derrida point to both the instability and the inevitability of form. We 
        needed to consider the problem of intermediate forms and figures. These 
        keep us from seeing in Nietzsche and reproducing in hypertext only an 
        accumulation of titillating fragments.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Hypertext philosophy needs to discover ways to enact complex interactions 
        that are neither flashy juxtapositions nor simple connections of topic 
        and comment. The new writing might seek fluidity and reuse, rather than 
        foundations and definitive position. It might provide paths that bring 
        us to read a given lexia more than once. "<font face="Garamond">The 
        form of the text is rhythmic, looping on itself in patterns and layers 
        that gradually accrete meaning, just as the passage of time and events 
        in one's lifetime.</font>" (Carolyn Guyer and Martha Petry)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Such forms and figures would acknowledge their own temporality. Stuart 
        Moulthrop has spoken of "<font face="Garamond">an approach to structure 
        as fundamentally transitional or contingent.</font>" The difficulty 
        in all this is to have the hypertext web embody something of the Socratic 
        critical watchfulness over what and how we speak. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I asked near the beginning of this essay, "What is thinking if not 
        linear?" What can "thinking" mean if it does not mean providing 
        beginnings, middles, and ends of the line? Perhaps we have the start of 
        an answer in these new figures that are neither arbitrary nor in complete 
        control. To let the local statements and areas of statement be what they 
        are, without demanding that they be fixed in a real or ideal totality. 
        Let the lexia be in an intermediate locality that belongs to shifting 
        regions. Let the particular "motion" of that "identity" 
        be, while critically acknowledging its limits and its connections, creating 
        a discourse that enacts its responsibility for itself in new figures.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Cavell remarks about Coleridge's <i>Bibliographia Literatia</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Garamond">To say that this book is composed without digression 
          means accordingly that if it has some end, the approach to it is followed 
          in as straightforward a path as the terrain permits. This suggests that 
          the end is, or requires, continuous self-interruption. But then this 
          will be a way of drawing the consequence of philosophy's self-description 
          as a discourse bearing endless responsibility for itself. And this could 
          be further interpreted as a matter of endless responsiveness to itself 
          - which might look to be exactly irresponsible.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Martin Heidegger entitled one of his collections of essays <i>Woodpaths</i> 
        (<i>Holzwege</i>). The title referred, he said, to fragmentary paths found 
        in the forest, leading nowhere, not converging, but opening up the dark 
        woods in one another's neighborhood. That plurality of paths seems an 
        appropriate image for the paths we may write in hypertexts, and for thought 
        as seeking what is to be said, with neither atomistic disintegration nor 
        final unity.<br>
