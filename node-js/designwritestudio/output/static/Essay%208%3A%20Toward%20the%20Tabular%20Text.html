Unlike hieroglyphic writing, whose pictographic component gives it a visual,
spectacular aspect, alphabetic writing was conceived as a transcription of
speech and was from its inception associated with the linearity of orality. This
linearity is aptly symbolized in the arrangement used in early Greek writing, in
which the characters in the ﬁrst line were aligned from left to right, and those
in the next line, from right to left, with the characters sometimes inverted,
imitating the path of a plow working a ﬁeld, a metaphor that gave this type of
writing its name: houstrophedon.1 Readers were supposed to follow with their
eyes the uninterrupted movement the hand of the scribe had traced.

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.2.html">8.2</a>
Orality thus extended its inﬂuence over the medium of text. The scribe
lined up columns of text on sheets of papyrus—which had been in use since
3000 BCE—until he came to the end of the scroll. Despite the characteristics
that made the papyrus scroll the quintessential book for three millennia, the
fact that it was rolled up into a volumen placed serious limitations on the
expansion of writing and helped maintain the book’s dependence on oral
language. It was taken for granted that readers would read from the ﬁrst line
to the last and that they had no choice but to immerse themselves in the text,
unrolling the volumen as a storyteller recounts a story in a strictly linear con—
tinuous order. In addition, readers needed both hands to unroll the papyrus,
which made it impossible to take notes or annotate the text. Worse still, as
Martial observed, readers would often have to use their chin when rerolling
the volumen, leaving marks on the edge that were rather off-putting to other
library users (“Sic noua nec mento sordida charta iuuat” [“How pleasant is
a new exemplar unsoiled by chins”] .2

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.3.html">8.3</a>
The advent of the codex was a radical break with this old order, and it
brought about a revolution in the reader’s relationship to the text. A codex
consists of pages folded and bound to form what we today call a book. These
pages were made of papyrus or parchmentmpaper having appeared in Eu-
rope only in the 11005. The codex emerged in classical Rome, several decades
before the Common Era, at the time of Horace, who used one himself as a
notebook. Smaller and easier to handle than a scroll, the codex was also more
economical, because it allowed scribes to write on both sides and even to
scrape off the surface and write on it again. But because of its antiquity, the
scroll was still considered to have greater dignity and was preferred by the
cultured elite, a status the codex did not acquire for several centuries. The
transition really took place only in the fourth century in the Roman Empire.
And it took even longer for the new medium to free itself from the model of
the volumenﬂjust as it took the automobile several decades to completely
rid itself of the model of the horse-drawn carriage. Such is the inertia of
dominant cultural representations.

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.4.html">8.4</a>
Christians were the ﬁrst to adopt the codex, which they used to spread the
Gospels. The new format, which was smaller, more compact, and easier to
hide and to handle than the scroll, also had the advantage of representing a
sharp break with the tradition of the Jewish Bible. Historians ﬁnd more and
more evidence that the latter reason was in part responsible for the choice
of the codex format by the Christians, but the wide adoption of the codex
over the following centuries was essentially due to “the twin advantages of
comprehensiveness and convenience.”

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.5.html">8.5</a>
The new element the codex introduced into the economy of the book was
the page. I will look at the problem of the integration of this important in-
novation into the digital order in the section “The End of the Page? [chapter
34]” It was the page that made it possible for text to break away from the
continuity and linearity of the scroll and allowed it to be much more easily
manipulated. Over the course of a slow but irreversible evolution, the page
made text part of the tabular order.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.6.html">8.6</a>
The codex is the quintessential book, without which the pursuit and dis-
semination of knowledge in our civilization could not have developed as fully
as they have. The codex gave rise to a new relationship between reader and
text. As one historian of the book writes, “This was a crucial development
in the history of the book, perhaps even more important than that brought
about by Gutenberg, because it modiﬁed the form of the book and required '
readers to completely change their physical position.”4 The codex left one
of the reader’s hands free, allowing him or her to take part in the cycle of
writing by making annotations, thus becoming more than a mere recipient
of the text. Readers could also now access the text directly at any point. A
bookmark let them take up reading where they left off, further altering their
relationship to the text. As another historian notes, it took “twenty centuries
for us to realize that the fundamental importance of the codex for our civili-
zation was to enable selective, noncontinuous reading, thus contributing to
the development of mental structures in which the text is dissociated from
speech and its rhythms.”5

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.7.html">8.7</a>
When the potential of this union of form and content in the page became
apparent, various types of visual markers were gradually added to the organi-
zation of the book to help readers ﬁnd their bearings more easily in the mass
of text and make reading easier and more efﬁcient. Since the page constitutes
a visual unit of information related to the preceding and the following pages,
allowing it to be numbered and given a header, it has an autonomy that the
column of text in the volumen did not. Thanks to the page, it is possible to leaf
through a book and quickly know its contents, or at least the essentials.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.8.html">8.8</a>
The page can be displayed for all to see, inviting monks in scriptoria to
combine text and images. While the papyrus was rolled up again after read-
ing, the codex can remain open to a double page, as demonstrated by the big
psalters of the Middle Ages that were displayed on their lecterns in churches.
The page was thus the place where the text, which was previously seen as a
mere transcription of the voice, entered the visual order. From then on, it
would increasingly be handled like a painting and enriched with illumina-
tions, something that was profoundly foreign to the papyrus scroll. One can-
not see these illuminated manuscripts without being struck by their fusion of
letter and image. Reading becomes a polysemiotic experience in which the
perception of the image, which is far from a mere illustration, enables readers
to recreate in their own mental space the tensions and emotions experienced
by the artist. The readable gradually moves into the realm of the visible.6

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.9.html">8.9</a>
The sight of the codex open on its lectern is emblematic of a religion whose
ideal was that all people should be able to read the sacred texts and share the
Revelation. Various other innovations gave rise to a change in the reader’s
relationship to the text and to reading. They include the insertion of spaces
between the words in Latin texts, which began about 700 CE in Irish scripto-
ria (Book of Kells) and led to decisive changes in the formatting of text.7 The
period from the eleventh to the thirteenth century saw the consolidation of
many features that allowed readers to escape the original linearity of speech,
such as the table of contents, the index, and the header. Paragraph breaks
indicated in the text by a pilcrow (9) made it easier for readers to deal with
units of meaning and helped them to follow the main divisions in the text.

This incunabulum from Thomas Aquinas’s Summa Theologica, printed in 1477 in Venice,
follows the manuscript tradition. The decorated initials and paragraph marks are hand—
drawn. The ﬁrst lines are in larger letters. There is no pagination. The layout of the text in
two columns and its organization in the form of questions and answers, however, make
it very readable. The illuminations are intensely symbolic. The ﬁrst page (bottom left) is
illustrated with an image that depicts the teaching of Thomas Aquinas. At the base of the
column, an image depicts the reception of the work by angels (bottom right).

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.11.html">8.11</a>
In the ﬁfteenth century, the printing revolution was another time of in-
tense reﬂection on the organization of the book. Febvre and Martin8 note
that the title page made its appearance—ﬁnally!——around 1480. After the
infancy of the modern book, the period of incunahula—books that imitated
manuscripts as faithfully as possible—printers quickly saw the full potential
of the page as a discrete semiotic space.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.12.html">8.12</a>
Page numbering, which became common in the mid-sixteenth century,
enabled readers to better control the duration and pace of their reading and
facilitated the discussion of texts by making it possible for readers of the same
edition to refer to the same passage. Once this step was taken, the move-
ment toward tabularization intensiﬁed, and sophisticated techniques allowing
multiple points of entry into the text became widely used, such as paragraph
summaries in the margin and the running head. It was now possible for
readers to precisely locate the point they had reached in their reading and to
compare the relative size of different sections—in short, to control their read-
ing progress. They could also forget the details of what they had read earlier,
since they could quickly ﬁnd them again by referring to a table of contents
or index. They could read only the parts of a book that interested them.
Especially if a book is long, readers often construct the meaning on the
basis of clues of various types. Typographical markers such as bold, capitals,
italics, or color allow them to quickly classify the elements they read and to
avoid ambiguity; for example, the italicization of foreign words prevents con-
fusion with homonyms. When justiﬁed by the material, an index of proper
names, a detailed index, or a bibliography permits readers to choose the way
of accessing the text that best suits their information needs of the moment.
These reading aids did not come into use all at once but were slowly reﬁned,
in a process that culminated in the golden age of print in the nineteenth cen-
tury, when the progress of mechanization heralded the triumph of the printed
page. The table of contents, for example, appeared in the twelfth century. The
paragraph break, the concept of which had been expressed through the use
of the pilcrow in manuscripts of the eleventh century, was ﬁnally indicated
by a line break, as seen in an edition of Gargantua printed in Lyon in 1537.
Thus shaped by the ergonomics of the codex, the text was no longer a linear
thread that was unreeled, but a surface whose content could be perceived from
various perspectives. These reading aids, which allow readers to consider the
text the same way they look at a painting or tableau, are here called tabular.

With the introduction of printing, the art of publishing ﬂuctuated between
the temptations of textual continuity and those of pictorial page layout. On
the one hand, an austere layout in which the text was rigidly aligned within
the frame of the page was best for emphasizing the mechanical perfection of
printing and the linear aspect of language and reading; on the other hand,
publishers could also be tempted by a complex layout in which the text was
presented in different visual blocks among which readers could pick and
choose as they wished, exploring their relationships in nonsequential order.
These ﬂuctuations in the ideal of the book can be observed across different
periods. In this regard, it is informative to compare some of the printing
manuals studied by the typography expert Fernand Baudin. A manual pub-
lished by the printer Fertel in 1723, entitled La science pratique de l’imprimerie,
is a model of complex layout in which marginal glosses sometimes spill over
into the space of the main text. In contrast, a manual published forty years
later, written by Fournier, presents the text in a single, rather narrow column
and seems to have gone back to the linear order. As for the book by Baudin,
who was himself a typ ographer and wished to give an account of an art that
was the passion of his life, it is in large format, with a column of glosses and
cross-references systematically running down one side of the main column
and sometimes even framing it, as Fertel’s glosses do.

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.14.html">8.14</a>
The challenge of printed text, in short, is to strike a balance between se-
mantic and visual demands, the ideal obviously being a combination of these
two modes of access to the text around a coherent focus. We can still ob—
serve the naive triumph of the visual over the semantic in even the titles of
sixteenth-century books, in which printers did not hesitate to cut out words
in order to create a symmetrical effect.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.15.html">8.15</a>
For Walter Ong, this segmentation shows that reading did not focus on
the visual aspect of the words grasped globally, but was still based on oral
practices; the presentation of the text was independent of its semantic aspect.
It is also likely that such practices involved a kind of playful allusion to a way
of reading that was already seen as outmoded.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.16.html">8.16</a>
Today, publishers make such effort to enable the reader to perceive com~
plete words that they sometimes hesitate to break a word at the end of a line,
and thus to use justiﬁed text, although that was the typographical ideal for
centuries, beginning in the time of the volumen. This concern with match
ing the semantic unit with the unit of visual perception is also evident in
magazines, which tend increasingly to make the text of articles ﬁt into the
space of the page or double page.

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.17.html">8.17</a>
It is now commonly acknowledged that the revolution of the codex was
not limited to ergonomics, but that it also had an impact on the nature of
content and the evolution of mentalities in general. Indeed, once a text is
perceived as a visual entity, and no longer as primarily oral, it lends itself
much more readily to criticism. The eye, given the richness of optic nerve
endings in the cortex, can mobilize the analytical faculties more easily and
more precisely than the ear. As historian Henri-Jean Martin notes on the
revolution of printing in the sixteenth century: “By the same token, any
reasoned argument was as if detached from the realms of God and men and
took on an objective existence. The written text became amoral because it
detached from the writing process and no longer demanded that the reader
take on responsibility for it by reading it aloud. This may have facilitated
heretical propositions.”


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.18.html">8.18</a>
The process by which the text became an autonomous object crossed a new
threshold during the Enlightenment, when the last barriers to its generali-
zed objectiﬁcation collapsed. That era coincided precisely with spectacular
growth in reading in Europe. We will come back to this question.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.19.html">8.19</a>
With the advent of newspapers and the mass-circulation press, which
underwent rapid expansion in the nineteenth century, the formatting of
text became even more tabular. In a radical departure from the original
linearity of speech, text was now presented in the form of visual blocks that
complemented and responded to each other on the eye-catching surface of
the page. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a> gave a name to the metaphor implicit in this arrange—
ment: the “mosaic” text. Indeed, newspapers provide a textual mosaic, in
which the reading of various types of information is subtly inﬂuenced by the
surrounding news, as has been pointed out by analysts of newspaper layout:
“For about a century, newspapers have been laid out in such a way that each
item of information, though ﬂat on the page, stands out by virtue of the mere
fact of its coexistence with other items of information on the page, which
in turn acquire their value from this competition? ’1” The same authors note
that until the end of the nineteenth century, newspapers consisted simply
of vertically aligned columns, each of which theoretically constituted a page
that went on without interruption. “This type of layout naturally favored a
temporal sequence of discourse: there were no interruptions for turning
pages, no illustrations to create a break or suspension of reading, and no
lead or subheading introducing secondary material. This form corresponds
exactly to the temporal logic of discourse: It is the presentation of logos in
movement, and not the staging of an event.”11


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.20.html">8.20</a>
The sudden appearance of banner headlines was the beginning of a new
kind of layout, one'no longer guided by the logic of discourse, but by a spa-
tial logic. “The number of columns, the use of rules, the weight of the type,
the font, the position of illustrations, and the use of color make it possible
to bring together or move apart, to select, and to separate the units that, in
the newspaper, are units of information. Layout then emerges as a rheto-
ric of space that destructures the order of discourse (its temporal logic) to
reconstitute an original discourse, which is precisely the discourse of the
newspaper.”12

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.21.html">8.21</a>
Today, there is no doubt that tabularity meets the formatting requirements
of information texts in that it allows the reader to apprehend them most
effectively. This is especially apparent in magazines, where the dominant
model involves framing textual material by means of a hierarchy of titles:
section heading, main heading and subheadings. A more substantial article
will often be presented in the form of a feature story that, in addition to the
main text, includes one or more sidebars elaborating on points raised in the
main text. Such fragmented layouts are sometimes criticized. Their primary
function is clearly to hold on to readers whose attention span is unsteady or
short, unlike a linear format, which is intended for the “serious reader.” This
way of breaking up text into different elements is also very well suited for
communicating a variety of information that readers can select according
to their interests. On the other hand, popular magazines may diverge a bit
from this ideal and give predominance to glossy ads and photographs in or—
der to entice the reader to leaf through their pages and absorb the discourse
of advertising.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.22.html">8.22</a>
When tabularity is taken into account, then, printed text is not exclusively
linear and tends to incorporate characteristics of the visual realm. Readers
are thus able to free themselves from the thread of the text and go directly
to relevant elements. A book may thus be said to be tabular when it involves
the simultaneous spatial presentation and highlighting of various elements
that may help readers identify the connections and ﬁnd information that
interests them as quickly as possible.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.23.html">8.23</a>
The concept of tabularity thus covers at least two distinct phenomena—4n
addition to designating an internal arrangement of data. On the one hand,
it refers to the various organizational means that facilitate access to the con—
tent of the text: This is functional tabularity, as shown in tables of contents,
indexes, and division into chapters and paragraphs. On the other hand,
tabularity also suggests that the page may be viewed in the same way as a
painting and may include data from various hierarchical levels: This is visual
tabularity, which enables readers to switch from reading the main text to
reading notes, glosses, ﬁgures, or illustrations, all of which are present within
the space of the double page. This visual tabularity, which is seen primarily
in newspapers and magazines, is also found in varying degrees in scholarly
books, which may present various types of text juxtaposed on a single page.
It is obviously highly developed in electronic publishing, as seen on the
Web pages of major newspapers, magazines, and encyclopedias. In addi-
tion, through a hybridization of publishing techniques, the layout of books
or magazines increasingly borrows from the methods of electronic publish—
ing, such as the use of color, underlining, and marking of text elements, with
cross-references to thumbnails or sidebars. In this type of tabularity, the text
is shaped like visual material, with blocks referring to each other on the page
surface and sometimes incorporating illustrations.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.24.html">8.24</a>
The spatial projection of the thread of the text obviously depends on the
format of the book. The smaller the book, the less manipulation of the visual
blocks is possible; readers are conﬁned to a continuous movement through a
single column of text with no interruption. This format, which was adopted,
for example, by the famous French collection Bibliotheque de la Pléiade, tends
to reinforce the ideal of a linear typography with nothing to break its regular-
ity. It is especially well suited to novels, which are read for content. National
traditions prevent French publishers from placing the table of contents at
the front of the book as it is in the English-speaking world, a position better
suited to the tabular ideal and to readers’ needs.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="8.25.html">8.25</a>
It should be added, however, that the degree of tabularity of a book will
also depend on its content and intended use. Thus, children’s books often do
not have page numbers: young readers have no need for them, since these
books are designed to be read or looked at from cover to cover and there is
no expectation of a reﬂective reading with note taking or references. Schol-
arly books, which are intended for readers for whom time is valuable, have
many tabular guideposts: volumes, chapters, sections, paragraphs, headers,
notes, introductory summaries, detailed index, index of proper names, and
bibliography. But the linear thread may still be a justiﬁable choice for devel-
oping an argument, insofar as the author wishes to ensure that the reader
follows the entire proof. On the other hand, the novel, which is derived from
the ancient art of the storyteller, generally demands sustained reading and
does not require elaborate tabular clues. The large number of chapters and
the hierarchy of sections in Victor Hugo’s novels, which often have a very
linear narrative thread, may be explained by the fact that these novels were
initially published in serial form in newspapers. Today, some writers, anxious
to make their readers read continuously and to have their work seen as high
literature, as different as possible from the tabular format of the magazine,
dispense altogether with chapters, and even paragraphs and punctuation.
