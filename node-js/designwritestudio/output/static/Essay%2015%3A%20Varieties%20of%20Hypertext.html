In computer science, the concept of hypertext designates a way of making
direct connections among various pieces of information, textual or nontex-
tual, that may or may not be located in the same ﬁle (or on the same “page”
by means of embedded links. Using an interface based primarily on visual
and intuitive elements such as color and icons, hypertext users can identify
the places in a document where additional information is attached and ac-
cess them directly with a mouse click.

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.2.html">15.2</a>
Literary theory also uses the term hypertext, but in a very different sense.
For Gérard Genette, for example, hypertext is “any text derived from a previ—
ous text either through simple transformation . . . or through indirect trans-
formation.”1 In this sense, James Joyce’s Ulysses is a hypertext of Homer’s
Odyssey. The current concept of hypertext, as it comes to us from computer
science and the Web, is closer to that of intertext as ﬁrst proposed by Julia
Kristeva and redeﬁned by Michael Riffaterre: “the perception, by the reader,
of a relationship between a work and others that have either preceded or fol-
lowed it.” But the two concepts do not coincide completely, since the intertext,
in this meaning, results from the act of reading, while the hypertext we are
talking about is a computer construct of links and data corresponding to ﬁles
or parts of ﬁles that can be displayed in windows of various dimensions.

<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.3.html">15.3</a>
There are many hypertext software programs. Among the pioneers are
Hypercard, Hyperties, KMS, Intermedia, and Notecards. Since the advent
of the Web, hypertext has been based mainly on HTML (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="HyperText.html">HyperText</a> Markup
Language), XML (Extensible Markup Language), and XHTML.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.4.html">15.4</a>
Historically, the term hypertext was created in 1965 by Ted Nelson, who
used it to designate a new way of writing on the computer, in which the
units of text could be accessed nonsequentially. The text thus created would
reproduce the nonlinear structure of ideas as opposed to the “linear” format
of books, ﬁlms, or speech. Nelson himself was indebted to a Visionary article
by Vannevar Bush, who in 1945 already envisaged a huge storage system for
human knowledge that anyone would be able to connect to and that would
allow them to annotate documents of interest. Even before the introduction
of the personal computer, Nelson had attempted to realize Bush’s dream us-
ing a computer system called Xanadu—the name of Mongol emperor Kublai
Khan’s palace, immortalized in a poem by Coleridge as a symbol of memory
and its accumulated treasures. Nelson’s Xanadu was supposed to lead to a
huge universal library system (docuverse), which could be consulted on
workstations by making “micropayments” for each information node ac-
cessed. Despite its commercial implications, Nelson’s model had a profound
inﬂuence on the evolution of hypertext, and the World Wide Web may be
seen as its culmination in an unrestricted form.

Hypertext can be used to manipulate data of all kinds, not only linguistic
data but also images, sound, video, and animation. It makes it possible to
regulate a reader’s interaction with a document by programming various
behavior into objects on the screen in relation to the reader’s movements
of the mouse: the author of a computer program can stipulate, for example,
that touching a certain word with the mouse pointer will change its form
or color or trigger a process that will lead to a new text. Through these fea-
tures, hypertext creates a radically new form of electronic dialogue in written
language. Even more numerous than the many forms of books, hypertext
products vary substantially in appearance and internal organization. Indeed,
computer technology can give digitized text any form imaginable.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.6.html">15.6</a>
In a text on paper, the paragraphs or blocks of information are arranged
in sequence, and the reader can access them essentially through contiguity,
relying on a number of tabular elements. In a hypertext, the various blocks
of information may be distinct and autonomous and may be located on a
single “page” or on separate “pages.” In accordance with the nature of the
document and the target readers, the author of a hypertext can provide ac—
cess by means of selection, association, contiguity, or stratiﬁcation, and these
modes can exist alone or in different combinations.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.7.html">15.7</a>
Selection. In the simplest case, selection, readers select the block of
information they want to read from a list or enter a letter on the
keyboard. The various blocks of information are distinct units with
no essential links among them. Readers are guided by a speciﬁc need
for information, which exists only until it is satisﬁed. This model is
typical of the catalogue, the entire organization of which is based on
the principle of expansion, with each word of the index leading to
a detailed description. Dictionaries also work on this principle, but
each of their entries can also contain references to other entries such
as synonyms, antonyms, and so on. The user may also select from the
list of pages already consulted in the document during the work ses-
sion or may choose from a table of contents or from a tree diagram
in which the various branchings are accessible at different hierarchi-
cal levels. Finally, the most frequent mode of selection is by means of
hyperlinks indicated by a particular color, on which the user clicks in
order to explore the content behind them.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.8.html">15.8</a>
Applied to a text of a certain scope, the principle of selection is
also characteristic of hypertext ﬁction in which each screen page
includes several links to other pages, making Jorge Luis Borges’s
ideal of forking paths a reality. Similarly, in the case of a philosophi-
cal essay, every block of text could be followed by a number of icons,
each one corresponding to a possible continuation of the text accor—
ding to the anticipated reactions of the reader insofar as the author
could predict them. After reading a segment of text, the reader could
select the most relevant continuation. In so doing, he or she would
become actively involved in reading, making choices, and expressing
opinions at every step through each section read. But the number
of combinations can easily skyrocket. If a block of text gives rise to
three choices, and each of these gives rise to another three, there
would be nine possible continuations of the initial text at the third
level, twenty—seven at the fourth level, and eighty—one at the ﬁfth. As
a result, 121 texts would have to be written for a sequence of ﬁve pa—
ragraphs to be accessible in perfectly “free” hypertext mode. Thus the
idea of providing choices at every level has to be abandoned, or their
proliferation would lead the reader into endless movement and force
the author to rigorously explore every logical alternative at each
point in the argument. Moreover, the freedom given the reader is pu-
rely artiﬁcial; it only reinforces the dominant position of the author,
who is the master of all possible outcomes.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.9.html">15.9</a>
Selection and association. In this mode, readers choose the element they
wish to consult but can also navigate among the blocks of informa-
tion, letting themselves be guided by the associations of ideas that
arise as they navigate and by the links offered them. This model is
typical of encyclopedias.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.10.html">15.10</a>
Selection, association, and contiguity. In addition to the above-men-
tioned modes of navigation, the blocks of information are here ac-
cessible sequentially, like the pages of a book. This model is suitable
for an essay or a scientiﬁc article and would be used, for example, for
adaptations of printed books. It corresponds to a simple transposi-
tion of codex format to electronic format. For example, in a hyper-
text adaptation of an essay such as Marvin Minsky’s Society of Mind,
readers can choose to select a title in the table of contents, search
for a word in the index, or move from section to section by scroll-
ing. The contiguity mode is useful only if a document is divided into
pages and sections that are supposed to be read in a speciﬁc order—
as is usually the case with a book.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.11.html">15.11</a>
Selection, association, contiguity, and stratiﬁcation. In addition to being
accessible by the above-mentioned modes, the elements of informa-
tion can be distributed in two or three hierarchical levels accord-
ing to their degree of complexity. This makes it possible to meet the
needs of various categories of readers or to satisfy different informa-
tion needs for a single reader. This hypertext model best combines
the advantages of the codex with the possibilities opened up by the
computer by taking into account a new dimension of the text, that of
depth. By superimposing different layers of text on a single subject,
or to use another metaphor, by encircling a central nucleus with vari-
ous supplementary documents, the uses of which are well deﬁned, a
stratiﬁed hypertext provides several books in one.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.12.html">15.12</a>
Users of such a hypertext could scroll through pages in a main
window, while at the same time being able to open one or more
secondary windows, providing more theoretical or more popular-
ized discourse. There are many ﬁelds in which this type of structure
with two or three layers, offering a basic discourse and additional
windows accessible on demand, is desirable. This is the case for self—
teaching textbooks and learning situations, for example, in which the
learner is confronted with a mass of interrelated concepts that may
not all be familiar. It is also the case for technical manuals in which
the user may at any time want to consult supplementary information
on a speciﬁc element.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.13.html">15.13</a>
These four modes of navigation may also be combined in the electronic edi-
tion of a work, opening up new perspectives for critical editions of works on
pap er. The main thread of reading would thus be the ﬁnal version of the text,
dominating the layers of the previous versions, which the reader could also
choose to display in parallel windows. The different pages of the text would
be accessed by contiguity or by selection in a table of contents. Finally, com-
ments, notes, and illustrations would be accessible through connections or
associative links. Because of the richness and diversity of the links provided,
I will call this ideal type of hypertext a “stratiﬁed” or “tabular” hypertext.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.14.html">15.14</a>
The success of a tool of this kind obviously depends on the consistency
and interest of the base layer. While this is relatively easy to determine in
the case of a critical edition, the same is not true for other documents. In a
textbook aimed at a diverse readership, the various strata of information it
should contain would have to be established. The base layer would contain
the main thread of the text, consisting of the minimum information at a
medium level of difﬁculty. On every page where needed, hyperlinks would
open one or two supplementary windows, such as a “novice” window for
users whose knowledge is insufﬁcient for them to grasp the main ideas and
an “expert” window for those who already possess the basic knowledge and
want to know more.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.15.html">15.15</a>
In creating an arrangement capable of working in depth and not only on
the surface of the thread of discourse, the author of a tabular hypertext must
take the utmost care in establishing the different layers and distributing the
information between the base level and the other layers. These choices will
vary with the type of text and target audience. The levels of information may
be distributed on the axis of concrete/ abstract or divided between narrative
and documents or between scholarly text, experimental data, and reference
works, or between didactic text, examples, and exercises, and so on.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.16.html">15.16</a>
Generally speaking, it does not seem desirable to create more than two
layers in addition to the base level. Increasing the number of layers will result
in a proliferation of cross—references, and reading would quickly become dif-
ﬁcult. It is important to remember that in a reader-based textual economy,
reference markers should be provided that allow readers to predict the re—
sults of their actions when moving the mouse pointer over the surface of the
screen. The presence of a “novice” or an “expert” layer linked to a particular
word or page should thus always be indicated in the same way, by an icon
or the use of a color. Novice readers who click on an icon hoping to ﬁnd an
explanation at their level would quickly become discouraged if, instead of
getting what they wanted, they encountered material intended for experts.
To be effective, reading must be based on stable conventions that enable
maximum concentration on the content.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.17.html">15.17</a>
Stratiﬁed hypertext will undoubtedly develop its own conventions just as
the print media did, and these will become part of readers’ culture. In spite
of the problems, this is where the most promising future for hypertext lies
if it is to move beyond the stage of utopian dreams of liberation to become
a productive working tool. However, these modes of organization of hyper—
text may lead to methods of navigation that are very different depending on
the degree of opacity or tabularity of the presentation of data. A literary or
game hypertext may opt for greater opacity in navigation and allow users to
produce events on the screen without knowing where they are or where they
are going. In this case, there are no obvious “movements,” since everything
occurs within the same visual framework. This form of opaque hypertext
may be suited to an experimental narrative such as Stuart Moulthrop’s He-
girascope3 or to an adventure game such as Myst, in which the players have
no idea of their position in relation to the puzzles to be solved. For an infor-
mational document, however, the most satisfying option for readers is one
that gives them a clear view of the distribution of information and enables
them to directly access all the blocks, with full control of their movement.
In this regard, it is signiﬁcant that some games allow players to choose the
episode they want and allow them to display the percentage of the episode
completed at any time.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.18.html">15.18</a>
One area where the user’s route cannot be left to chance is learning. In-
structional programs and textbooks are based precisely on the principle that
the acquisition of knowledge cannot take place in random order guided only
by the learner’s associations. The ﬁrst computer-assisted learning (CAL) pro-
grams took this principle of the sequential path to the limit, locking students
into programmed paths in which access to each exercise was conditional on
success in the previous one. Students were expected to move forward blindly,
without knowing how many steps they would have to go through or even,
sometimes, what they would actually learn from the program. Hypertext,
too, can be used in an opaque manner, to totally control users’ progress,
allowing them to follow only branchings accepted by the logic of the pro-
gram, thus reinforcing traditional practices of computer- assisted learning. I
believe, however, that hypertext should adopt some of the characteristics of
the age—old technology of the book to create a new product that will satisfy
the needs of demanding readers who use it as a tool for informational or
educational purposes.


<hr>





<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="15.19.html">15.19</a>
As we can see, the production of a hypertext requires constant strategic
choices by the author. The distribution of elements of information also poses
the problem of identifying every primary textual unit with a title. If these
titles are meaningful to the users, it will be easier for them not only to ﬁnd
the information they want, but also to keep track of which pages they have
read when they exit from the hypertext. In this way, readers will be able to
have real control over the text instead of being controlled by it or groping
their way through it.
