How can the rapidly evolving new media be integrated into curricula that still seek to transmit'traditional'literary competence?Â How can the notion of literary competence be broadened to take into account these current trends?Â This study, which argues for hypertext's integration in the literary canon, offers a critical overview of developments in hypertext theory, an exemplary hypertext canon and an evaluation of possible classroom applications.},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Author = {Ensslin, Astrid},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">ISBN = {9780826495587},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Publisher = {Continuum},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Series = {Continuum Literary Studies},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Title = {Canonizing Hypertext : Explorations and Constructions.},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">URL = {http://sunypoly.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=377717&amp;site=eds-live},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Year = {2007},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">}</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">@book{2088719990101,</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Abstract = {Previous ed.: 1993.},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Author = {McAleese, Ray},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">ISBN = {9781871516289},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Publisher = {Intellect Books},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Title = {Hypertext : Theory Into Practice.},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Volume = {2nd ed},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">URL = {http://sunypoly.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=20887&amp;site=eds-live},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Year = {1999},</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">}</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">@book{9126920020101,</span><br /><span class="medium-normal">Abstract = {Once the basic idea of hypertext had spread rapidly throughout the world via the Internet, the reception of hypertexts soon became subject of empirical research among psychologists, cognitive scientists, and educational researchers. As easy to use software for the writing of hypertexts (HTML editors) is now broadly available, there are no longer any technical obstacles for the use of hypertext production in teaching and learning. This book presents and analyses the learning effects that can be anticipated from the production of hypertexts. It includes laboratory experiments, studies on the production of hypertexts in the context of educational institutions, and reports on software environments designed for the production of hypertext.

Barnet combines an analysis of contemporary literature with her exclusive interviews with those at the forefront of the hypertext innovation.

Barnet argues that some of the earliest hypertext systems were more richly connected and in some respects more flexible than the Web; this is also a fascinating account of the paths not taken.

He then devotes the final part of the book to applications that unite infrastructure and analysis to bring machine learning to bear on systematically acquired and stored data.

Glazier's work not only introduces the reader to the current state of electronic writing but also outlines the historical and technical contexts out of which electronic poetry has emerged and demonstrates some of the possibilities of the new medium. Glazier examines three principal forms of electronic textuality: hypertext, visual/kinetic text, and works in programmable media.

Katherine Hayles uses the autobiographical persona of Kaye to explore how literature has transformed itself from inscriptions rendered as the flat durable marks of print to the dynamic images of CRT screens, from verbal texts to the diverse sensory modalities of multimedia works, from books to technotexts.Weaving together Kaye's pseudo-autobiographical narrative with a theorization of contemporary literature in media-specific terms, Hayles examines the ways in which literary texts in every genre and period mutate as they are reconceived and rewritten for electronic formats. As electronic documents become more pervasive, print appears not as the sea in which we swim, transparent because we are so accustomed to its conventions, but rather as a medium with its own assumptions, specificities, and inscription practices.
