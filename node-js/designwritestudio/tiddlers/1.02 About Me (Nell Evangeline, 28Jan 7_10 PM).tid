comments: Sorry for the lateness! I had the flu. I probably should've gone and got myself excused by a doctor until i could work again, but it's a bit late for that now. I know how to get seen at the wellness center now though, so it shouldn't happen again. I wanted to do this anyway to make sure I pick up the skills being taught.
