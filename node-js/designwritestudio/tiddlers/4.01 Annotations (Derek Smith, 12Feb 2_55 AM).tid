comments: I am playing round with they story telling feature, kind of turning my wiki into a crappy book filled with my annotation around some stories. But I feel that it works well for this project because there is so much information. Jumping to "TOC for TOC" is an easy way to consume all of the information but I feel it is better presentation to start on the articles page
