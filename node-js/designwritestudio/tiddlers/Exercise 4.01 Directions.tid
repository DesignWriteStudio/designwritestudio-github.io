whats-new: Directions for the Annotation exercise

(these directions were generated in the [[Workshop: Annotating Sources]])<br>

# Create new wiki/tiddler
# Identify and download text of two articles that looks interesting: one focused on hypertext and one focused on annotation
# Ingest each article into their own tiddlers
# Use excise tool to split articles into paragraphs or sections
# Use some of these techniques (or others that you develop) to annotate the articles:
## Add tags to paragraph/section tiddlers
## `[[bracket keywords]]` to make new tiddlers
## Use ``new here`` to create annotations
