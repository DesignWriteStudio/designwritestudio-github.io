You noted that "length of tenure" was not an acceptable field name - but length-of-tenure would have worked fine • Because your field "years" was text instead of numeric, it sorts alpha not numerically • Template looks good! • Use the google group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/designwrite for issues like not being able to save in TiddlySpot!
