title: Digitization as a form of Interactivity
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

If to interact with is to change, then a change in the material form of an object is a form of interactivity. So digitizing a printed text is a way of interacting with a printed text, just like <span class="yellow-hilite">hilighting</span> and annotating. 

If we say that one can interact with a book by hilighting, we should also say that one can interact with a book by digitizing.
