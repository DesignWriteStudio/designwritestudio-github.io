>2.2 Rhizomes and hypotexts

>Hypertexts should not be confused (like Robinson and McGuire 2010 and Tredinnick 2013 do) with rhizomes (Deleuze and Guattari 1976; Eco 1984, 112; Landow 2006, 58-62; Eco 2007, 59-61; Mazzocchi 2013, 368-369), which constitute the limit case of hypertexts in which each node is mechanically linked to all the other nodes belonging to the same document, without selection by its author (Finnemann 1999, 27), among all the logically possible links, of only those considered to be useful, meaningful or at least sensible. Therefore rhizome is the term that can be used to indicate those hyptertexts (though neither very widespread nor particularly useful) so radically multilinear as to provide links from each node to all other nodes. Similarly, Ridi (1996) proposed the term hypotext (understood in a different way from Genette 1982 [1]) to indicate documents with little hypertextuality and, in particular, those so little multilinear as to be configured as unilinear documents in which each node is linked only to the previous node and to the next one, with the possible exceptions (in non-circular documents) of the first and the last node of the series.
