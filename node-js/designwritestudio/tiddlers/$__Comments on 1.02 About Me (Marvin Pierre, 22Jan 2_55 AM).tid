title: $:/Comments on 1.02 About Me (Marvin Pierre, 22Jan 2:55 AM)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

√ ``About Me`` √ ``About Me in Tags`` X ``<<list-links>>`` macro -- implement in tiddlers such as ``unhealthy snacks`` like this: ``<<list-links "[tag[unhealthy snacks]]">>`` • Interesting question if "order matters" - it doesn't from a technical perspective, but it might from a cognitive perspective • you tagged places such s ``Latin America`` as ``travelling`` not ``Travelling`` as you referenced in ``[[About Me in Tags]]`` • Lots of countries! Perfect source material for projects.
