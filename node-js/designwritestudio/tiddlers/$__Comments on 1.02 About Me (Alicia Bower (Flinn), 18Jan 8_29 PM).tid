√ ``About Me`` √ ``About Me in Tags`` √ ``<<list-links>>`` macro • Nicely done. A few errors that you could correct someday, mostly in syntax. For example in ``About Me in Tags`` you have ``<< tag "Weedsport School District>>`` which fails to render as desired; try ``<<tag "Weedsport School District">>`` instead.
