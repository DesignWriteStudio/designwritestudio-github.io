√ ``About Me`` X ``About Me in Tags`` X ``<<list-links>>`` macro -- implement in tiddlers such as ``Work`` like this: ``<<list-links "[tag[Work]]">>`` • Max, you didn't use the ``<<list-links>>`` macro in your tags. None of your tags gather multiple tiddlers under s common tag; there seems to be a disconnect in understanding what tags do.
