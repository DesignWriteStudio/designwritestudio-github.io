√ ``About Me`` √ ``About Me in Tags`` √ ``<<list-links>>`` macro • Love to see colored tags. And the change in the way tag displays (how did you do that?). You have a space after ``About Me`` in your default; that's why that didn't work. The value of tags for concepts like ``born`` is not clear. But you are ready for stretch text - start a new thread in the group ``How do I use stretch text?`` and I'll write a brief set of instructions!
