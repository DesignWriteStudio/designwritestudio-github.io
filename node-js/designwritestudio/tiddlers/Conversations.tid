* During the course of the semester, I hope to host and post "Chats with Scholars." I will engage in a discussion with invited scholars, record the conversation, and post it for students to review.
* Ideally, video can flip between "talking head" mode and screen-sharing mode. Any of the participants should be able to share their screen.
* We may have up to 3 guests at a time, for a total of 4 video views.
* Video should be posted to a reliable location and viewed publicly.
