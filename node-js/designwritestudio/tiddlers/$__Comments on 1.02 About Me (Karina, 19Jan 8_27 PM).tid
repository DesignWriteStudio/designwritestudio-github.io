√ ``About Me`` X ``About Me in Tags`` X ``<<list-links>>`` macro • In your tag tiddlers (such as ``personal life``) you hard-coded the links; instead, use the ``<<list-links>>`` as requested in [[Exercise 1.02 Directions]] • Also, when you referenced ``personal life`` in ``About Me in Tags`` you put ``<<tag "Personal Life">>`` rather than ``<<tag "personal life">>`` (everything is case sensitive).
