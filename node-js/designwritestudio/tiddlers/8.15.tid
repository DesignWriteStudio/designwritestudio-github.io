For Walter Ong, this segmentation shows that reading did not focus on
the visual aspect of the words grasped globally, but was still based on oral
practices; the presentation of the text was independent of its semantic aspect.
It is also likely that such practices involved a kind of playful allusion to a way
of reading that was already seen as outmoded.
