title: Monads are expressed as different ways of navigating through data sets
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* "The experience of moving easily through profiles  makes clear that ''what is meant by" individuals and aggregates'' does not refer to different domains of reality but to different ways of navigating through data sets
* ‘Specific’ and ‘general’, ‘individual’ and ‘collective’, ‘actor’ and ‘system’ are not essential realities but provisional terms that ''depend rather on the ease with which it is possible to navigate through profiles and to envelop them inside their names''
