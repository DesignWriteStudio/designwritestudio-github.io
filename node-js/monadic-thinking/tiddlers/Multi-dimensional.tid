title: Multi-dimensional
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* The //hyper// in //hypertext// means multi-dimensional.
* [[Nelson|Nelson: hyper, as in hyperspace, 1965]] meant "hypertext" to be compared to "hyperspace", and to invoke the sense of multiple dimensions, unseen, unseeable but mathematically postulated so therefore likely to exist.
* In science fiction, hyperspace refers to "a space or more than three dimensions"
* Hypertext, then, is text constructed in, and experienced in, more than the usual number of dimensions.
