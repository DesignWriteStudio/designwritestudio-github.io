He has carried Pennsylvania and New-Jersey;- and unless he loses some of the Southern States, which have been generally conceded to him, his election is already more than probable. Scattering returns from Maryland give FILLMORE an increased vote, and it is by no means impossible that he may have carried the State. If so, it would leave BUCHANAN four votes short of an election, and this deficit may be still further increased if Louisiana, Delaware or Kentucky should not have given him their votes.</p>

It elects ABRAHAM LINCOLN of Illinois; President, and HANNIBAL HAMLIN of Maine, Vice-President of the United States, for four years, from the 4th March next, directly by the People: These Republican Candidates having a clear majority of the 309 Electorial votes of the 33 States, over all three of the opposing tickets.</p>

Southern states responded by peeling away from the Union. Despite their old Illinois rivalry, before Mr. Lincoln’s inauguration, the defeated Democrat, Stephen A. Douglas, called on the victor to offer help amid the gathering storm. Mr. Lincoln replied, “God bless you, Douglas.”</p>

The footings, as between the Republican and Democratic counties in New-York, so closely approximate each other on the electoral ticket, as now reported and estimated, that we scarcely feel justified in saying that New-York has gone for Grant.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Gen. Grant, the hero of Appomattox, who backed the Radical Republicans’ plans for Reconstruction of the South, was swept into office with the aid of newly empowered African-American voters. His opponent, former Gov. Horatio Seymour of New York, had run on a Democratic platform that insisted on states’ rights.</p>

Henry Wilson, Vice-President elect, had quite an ovation when he appeared on the platform.<br/>     He felt as though great victory had been won, and thought that all personal triumphs should be merged into the victory of the Republican Party. He hoped that all would feel that they had done their duty, and said the Republican Party was stronger than ever before. We have heard a great deal about “purification,” and we have got it. [Applause.] He hoped that the next four years would be better than the last, and that wherever there was a Federal abuse it would be corrected.</p>

On Wednesday the following States were put down as surely Republican: Colorado, California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Nebraska, New-Hampshire, Oregon, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Louisiana, and South Carolina. Some of these States were claimed by the Democrats, but all intelligence, thus far received, not only shows that the above estimate was correct, but that Florida, which was left in doubt, has gone Republican by at least 1,500 majority.</p>

Every Northern State except New-Jersey has declared for Garfield and Arthur, giving them 222 of the 369 votes of the Electoral College, and an overwhelming majority of the popular vote. The Democratic Presidential candidates will receive but 147 Electoral votes. The Times’s dispatches tell of heavy Republican gains over the vote of 1876 everywhere except in New-Hampshire, where, however, the Garfield Electors and a Republican Governor have been chosen. The magnitude of the victory in this State surpasses all expectation. The Democratic majority in New-York City has been reduced to 41,000, and in Brooklyn it will not exceeed 10,000. Maine redeems herself with a Republican majority of between 4,000 and 5,000.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Benefiting from Republican strength in northern states, Mr. Garfield won with an astonishingly small national margin of less than 2,000 popular votes, but, stricken in July 1881 by an assassin’s bullet, would serve for only half a year as president.</p>

At 5 o’clock this morning the returns indicated that President Coolidge had secured 357 electoral votes, Davis 136 and La Follette 13, and that 25 votes in five Western States were still in doubt. The principal overtures in the late returns were in Kentucky and Missouri. In Kentucky, in 3,431 out of 3,971 precincts, seven-eighths of the State, Coolidge had 337,838, against 331,244 for Davis.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">The austere Mr. Coolidge had smoothly taken up the reins of power after President Warren G. Harding’s death, made it clear that he stood apart from Teapot Dome and other Harding scandals, and taken credit for national prosperity. His opponent, John W. Davis, was so much a vestige of the old Southern reactionary elements of the Democratic Party that in the early 1950s, he defended the “separate but equal” doctrine before the Supreme Court during the run-up to its Brown v. Board of Education decision.</p>

Smith of New York, nominee for President, and Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas, the Vice Presidential nominee, cannot be determined until the stupendous task of counting 40,000,000 or more votes is completed, but a Republican landslide took place at the polls, and it will be reflected in a heavy Hoover-Curtis majority of the 531 ballots in the Electoral College.</p>

A political cataclysm, unprecedented in the nation’s history and produced by three years of depression, thrust President Herbert Hoover and the Republican power from control of the government yesterday, elected Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt President of the United States, provided the Democrats with a large majority in Congress and gave them administration of the affairs of many States of the Union.<br/>     Fifteen minutes after midnight, Eastern Standard Time, The Associated Press flashed from Palo Alto this line: “Hoover concedes defeat.”</p>

Accepting the President as the issue, nearly eight million more voters than ever before had gone to the polls in the United States — about 45,000,000 persons — yesterday gave to Franklin Delano Roosevelt the most overwhelming testimonial of approval ever received by a national candidate in the history of the nation.<br/>     Except for the small corner of New England occupied by Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire — which was oscillating between Republican and Democratic in the early morning bouts of Wednesday — the President was the choice of a vast preponderance of the voters in all parts of the country.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Americans were still suffering from depression — unemployment remained at nearly 17 percent — but they appreciated Mr. Roosevelt’s efforts to find them jobs and save their homes.</p>

Over an apparently huge popular minority, which under the electoral college system was not able to register its proportion of the total vote in terms of electors, President Roosevelt was chosen yesterday for a third term, the first American in history to break the tradition which began with the Republic. He carried to victory with him Henry A. Wallace to be Vice President, and continued control of the House of Representatives by the Democrats was also indicated in the returns.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">With Europe at war, Mr. Roosevelt had been cheered by the nomination by the Republicans of Wendell Willkie, known as an internationalist who shared the president’s view that the United States must support Great Britain’s effort to resist Adolf Hitler’s Germany. But that fall, Mr. Willkie wildly charged that if re-elected, Mr. Roosevelt would take the nation into battle, and zoomed upward in the polls. After his defeat, Mr. Willkie airily dismissed his own accusations as “campaign oratory.”</p>

Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who broke more than a century-old tradition in 1940 when he was elected to a third term as President, made another political record yesterday when he was chosen for a fourth term by a heavy electoral but much narrower popular majority over Thomas E. Dewey, Governor of New York.<br/>     At 3:15 A.M. Governor Dewey conceded Mr. Roosevelt’s re-election, sending him best wishes by radio, to which the President quickly responded with an appreciative telegram.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">The most important story of this campaign was Mr. Roosevelt’s success in concealing his advanced cardiovascular disease, which killed him in April 1945. In private, he talked about resigning the presidency after World War II was won — perhaps to head the new United Nations — and showed signs of understanding that his choice for vice president, Harry S. Truman, might succeed him in office; he advised the Missourian not to campaign by airplane because one of them had to survive.</p>

The State of Ohio, “mother of Republican Presidents,” furnished the electoral bloc early yesterday forenoon which assured to President Harry S. Truman a four-year term in his own right as Chief Executive of the United States. Until this late accounting of votes cast in Tuesday’s general election put Ohio firmly in Mr. Truman’s column, after it had fluctuated throughout the night, he was certain of but 254 electoral votes, which were twelve less than the 266 required.<br/>     The historic role played by Ohio was only one of the dramatic and extraordinary phases of the election of 1948.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Widely viewed at the time as a bland accidental president too small for his job, Mr. Truman won his enduring claim on Americans’ imaginations with his cheerful, fighting comeback, smilingly holding up a mistaken headline (“Dewey Defeats Truman”) afterward. To this day, Truman’s doughtiness is the model for all candidates who find themselves running behind.</p>

Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected President of the United States yesterday in an electoral vote landslide and with an emphatic popular majority that probably will give his party a small margin of control in the House of Representatives but may leave the Senate as it is—forty-nine Democrats, forty-seven Republicans and one independent.<br/>     Senator Richard M.

          <p class="g-text historian">The heart of the Republican Party may have belonged to the isolationist Senator Robert Taft of Ohio (who almost won its nomination), but its head belonged to Gen.

Dwight David Eisenhower won yesterday the most spectacular Presidential election victory since Franklin D. Roosevelt submerged Alfred M. Landon in 1936.<br/>     The smiling 66-year-old hero of the Normandy invasion, who was in a Denver hospital recuperating from a heart attack just a year ago today, thus became the first Republican in this century to win two successive Presidential elections. William McKinley did it in 1895 and 1900.<br/>     Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, who lost to Mr. Eisenhower four years ago, thirty-nine states to nine, conceded defeat at 1:25 this morning.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Gen. Eisenhower’s only Achilles’ heel that year was his health; his coronary had been followed by ileitis surgery. But voters were satisfied that he was up to the task, despite Mr. Stevenson’s uncharacteristically crude warning that the president was so frail that if re-elected, his vice president, Richard Nixon, would “probably” succeed him within four years. Pre-election crises over Suez and Hungary also highlighted Ike’s world stature.</p>

Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts finally won the 1960 Presidential election from Vice President Nixon by the astonishing margin of less than two votes per voting precinct.<br/>     Senator Kennedy’s electoral vote total stood yesterday at 300, just thirty-one more than the 269 needed for election. The Vice President’s total was 185. Fifty-two additional electoral votes, including California’s thirty-two, were still in doubt last night.<br/>     But the popular vote was a different story. The two candidates ran virtually even. Senator Kennedy’s lead last night was little more than 300,000 in a total tabulated vote of about 66,000,000 cast in 165,826 precincts.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Mr. Kennedy’s popular vote margin shrank to about 100,000 votes, and he won 303 electoral votes. Mr. Nixon and other Republicans pondered demanding recounts, especially in Texas and Illinois. The vice president dropped the idea; however, he told a friend that December, “We won, but they stole it from us.”</p>

Lyndon Baines Johnson of Texas compiled one of the greatest landslide victories in American history yesterday to win a four-year term of his own as the 36th President of the United States.<br/>     Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, Mr. Johnson’s running mate on the Democratic ticket, was carried into office as Vice President.<br/>     Mr. Johnson’s triumph, giving him the “loud and clear” national mandate he had said he wanted, brought 44 states and the district of Columbia, with 486 electoral votes, into the Democratic column.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Despite Mr. Johnson’s monumental victory, we know now — especially from his secret tapes — that for some of that evening, he was sad and angry.

Richard Milhous Nixon emerged the victor yesterday in one of the closest and most tumultuous Presidential campaigns in history and set himself the task of reuniting the nation.<br/>     Elected over Hubert H. Humphrey by the barest of margins—only four one-hundredths of a percentage point in the popular vote—and confronted by a Congress in control of the Democrats, the President-elect said it “will be the great objective of this Administration at the outset to bring the American people together.”</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Mr. Humphrey had nearly prevailed with the aid of President Lyndon Baines Johnson’s Halloween declaration that he would halt bombing in Vietnam to start peace talks, but America’s South Vietnamese allies had refused to attend. Privately, Mr. Johnson was irate when he discovered that Nixon’s entourage was secretly enticing Saigon to boycott the talks; he threatened to publicly reveal this “treason” and try to destroy Mr. Nixon’s election chances, but finally held his fire.</p>

Richard Milhous Nixon won re-election by a huge majority yesterday, perhaps the largest ever given a President.<br/>     Mr. Nixon scored a stunning personal triumph in all sections of the country, sweeping New York and most other bastions of Democratic strength.<br/>     He was gathering more than 60 per cent of the nation’s ballots, a trend that could bring him more than 500 electoral votes.<br/>     The victory was reminiscent of the landslide triumphs of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, although it could fall just short of their record proportions.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Mr. Nixon much later observed that his landslide did not prevent him from feeling “melancholy” that night. He blamed his party’s failure to win the Senate and House and the continuing Indochina war, but allowed that the more basic reason for his feeling might have been his knowledge that the still-embryonic Watergate scandal could, as it did, come to devastate his presidency.</p>

Jimmy Carter won the nation’s Bicentennial Presidential election yesterday, narrowly defeating President Ford by sweeping his native South and adding enough Northern industrial states to give him a bare electoral vote majority.<br/>     Three of the closely contested battleground states slipped into Mr. Carter’s column shortly after midnight—New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. The President-designate lost New Jersey and Michigan, Mr. Ford’s home state, while Ohio, Illinois and California were still up for grabs.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Mr. Ford probably kicked away his chances in this tight election with a single gaffe. While debating with Mr. Carter, clumsily trying to suggest America’s unwillingness to accept Soviet power in Eastern Europe, he had insisted that there was “no Soviet domination” there, convincing many Americans that, even compared to the neophyte Carter, their president did not know as much as he should about national security.</p>

Ronald Wilson Reagan, riding a tide of economic discontent against Jimmy Carter and promising “to put America back to work again,” was elected the nation’s 40th President yesterday with a sweep of surprising victories in the East, South and the crucial battlegrounds of the Middle West.<br/>     At 69 years of age, the former California Governor became the oldest person ever elected to the White House. He built a stunning electoral landslide by taking away Mr. Carter’s Southern base, smashing his expected strength in the East, and taking command of the Middle West, which both sides had designated as the main testing ground.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">This was a surprisingly close race until the single Reagan-Carter debate, nine days before the election. Mr. Reagan’s masterful display dispelled suspicions that he was a shallow Hollywood figure who was eager to court nuclear war. Combined with a disastrous economy, Soviet advances in Afghanistan and Mr. Carter’s failure to free American hostages in Iran, it helped Mr. Reagan sway undecided voters, roust the incumbent and retake the Senate for the Republicans.</p>

Ronald Wilson Reagan won a second term as President yesterday in an election that Republican leaders hailed as a sweeping personal triumph and a mandate for his policies.<br/>     Mr. Reagan secured clear landslide victories in both popular and electoral votes as he defeated Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic nominee, in at least 48 of the 50 states.<br/>     However, it remained unclear whether the powerful tide of support for Mr. Reagan ran deeply enough to carry enough Republican Congressional candidates into office to secure the “historic electoral realignment” that the President asked the voters to deliver.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Boosted by prosperity and his robust popularity, deepened by his graceful reaction to a near-fatal shooting in 1981, Mr. Reagan was justified to feel confident about his re-election, except for after his first debate with Mr. Mondale, when his halting performance jarred many viewers to worry that the intellect of their 73-year-old president (the oldest ever) might be starting to fail — a scare that Mr. Reagan tamped down with aplomb and humor in the second debate.</p>

George Herbert Walker Bush of Texas was elected the 41st President of the United States yesterday.<br/>      The Vice President fashioned a solid, 6-to-5 victory in the popular vote over Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts with a sweep of the once Democratic South. He captured enough major states in other regions to win a commanding majority in the Electoral College.<br/>      Of the total of 538 electoral votes, Mr. Bush appeared likely to get from 350 to 415.<br/>      His solid victory notwithstanding, Mr. Bush did little to help Republican candidates for the Senate.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Mr. Bush managed to overcome what he privately called his “Martin Van Buren” problem, becoming the first sitting vice president since 1836 to be elected to succeed the chief executive he had served. Mr. Bush’s victory was widely considered, at least in part, a referendum demanding another term for the still-popular President Ronald Reagan. But the Republicans’ failure to take Congress gave Democrats opportunities to undermine Mr. Bush’s presidency and his chances for a second term.</p>

Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas was elected the 42d President of the United States yesterday, breaking a 12-year Republican hold on the White House.<br/>     Mr. Clinton shattered the Republicans’ political base with a promise of change to an electorate clearly discontented with President Bush.<br/>     Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who roiled this race throughout, finished third, drawing roughly equally from both major party candidates.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Although Mr. Perot siphoned votes from both major-party nominees, his campaign was an almost unrelieved, sometimes scathing critique of the incumbent. Withdrawing from the race for a time that summer, Mr. Perot had even praised Mr. Clinton’s “revitalized” Democratic Party. Mr. Bush was also injured by violating his 1988 “no new taxes” pledge, a flagging economy, Mr. Clinton’s talents as a campaigner and debater, and the claim by a special prosecutor just before the election that Mr. Bush had been more involved than he had attested in the Iran-contra scandal.</p>

William Jefferson Clinton was re-elected President of the United States yesterday, capping a yearlong political resurgence that made him the first Democrat since Franklin Delano Roosevelt to win a second term as President.<br/>     Mr. Clinton built a landslide in the Electoral College and won a decisive victory in the popular vote, overwhelming Bob Dole in all regions of the country except the South and the High Plains, where the Republican won several states. The President’s sweep carried to California, where Mr. Dole, in an enormous gamble, diverted millions of dollars from other states and stumped doggedly in the final weeks of the campaign.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Mr. Clinton had lost both houses of Congress in 1994, but he was blessed by relative peace and prosperity and the fact that Mr. Dole, while gifted as a parliamentarian, was out of his element in presidential politics. In his memoirs, Mr. Clinton attributed his failure to win a more resounding re-election, in part, to “the power of cultural issues like guns, gays and abortion,” which, so he wrote, impelled him to “keep searching for common ground.”</p>

For the first time in more than a century, the winner of a presidential election remained unknown a full day after the polls closed, as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore dispatched teams of lawyers to Florida yesterday to wrangle over the handful of votes upon which their White House dreams now rest.<br/>     The fate of the two rivals appeared to ride on the verdict in Florida, where an incomplete vote count had Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore by 1,784 votes, an extraordinarily narrow margin in a nationwide race in which more than 96 million people voted.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">The spectacle of an election decided by the Supreme Court could have been avoided. According to some polls, Mr. Bush might have won outright but for the revelation, the week before the election, of a 1976 drunk-driving arrest. And Mr. Gore might have done so but for his inconsistent debate performances and public ambivalence about the legacy of President Bill Clinton, whose poll ratings had rebounded after his impeachment and acquittal, and who was still presiding over a thriving economy.</p>

Exactly five weeks after one of the most unsettled presidential elections in American history, George Walker Bush appeared tonight to have swept away any lingering legal obstacles, gaining the right, at long last, to consider himself president-elect.<br/>     While the campaigns of Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore were still reading and digesting the Supreme Court’s tangled and elaborate ruling as midnight approached, officials in both camps said it was now virtually impossible for Mr. Gore to reach the White House.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Americans may well argue until the end of time about which presidential candidate those Floridians who cast ballots in 2000 really intended to vote for. The outcome was affected by confusing “butterfly ballots” and other peculiarities, Florida’s election law and judicial process, and the inner workings of the highest court in the land. Predictions that Mr. Bush might have difficulty asserting full presidential authority after the narrow Supreme Court verdict proved to be premature, especially after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</p>

George W. Bush declared victory yesterday in the race for president after a decisive national election that bolstered Republican strength in Congress and led the White House to proclaim that Mr. Bush had won a mandate from the American public for a second term.<br/>     Mr. Bush beamed as he stood with Vice President Dick Cheney at a rally in Washington four hours after accepting a concession call at the White House from Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who waged a fierce challenge to unseat him.<br/>     “We had a long night — and a great night,” Mr. Bush said.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Although Mr. Bush won with 50.7 percent of the popular vote, his electoral majority was narrow enough that had Ohio (which he ultimately won by 2.1 percent) gone the other way, Mr. Kerry would have become president. Four days before the balloting, a videotape by the Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was released. Polls suggested that this event was key to Mr. Bush’s re-election because it reminded people of the continuing terrorist danger and his firmness in meeting it.</p>

Barack Hussein Obama was elected the 44th president of the United States on Tuesday, sweeping away the last racial barrier in American politics with ease as the country chose him as its first black chief executive. The election of Mr. Obama amounted to a national catharsis — a repudiation of a historically unpopular Republican president and his economic and foreign policies, and an embrace of Mr. Obama’s call for a change in the direction and the tone of the country. But it was just as much a strikingly symbolic moment in the evolution of the nation’s fraught racial history, a breakthrough that would have seemed unthinkable just two years ago.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">A September market crash, ushering in the Great Recession, helped to turn a close race into a rout that brought the ascent of the first African-American president. With a graciousness that seems almost antique only eight years later, John McCain conceded defeat by saying that, despite their political differences, Mr. Obama was a “good man” who “has achieved a great thing for himself and his country.”</p>

Barack Hussein Obama was re-elected president of the United States on Tuesday, overcoming powerful economic headwinds, a lock-step resistance to his agenda by Republicans in Congress and an unprecedented torrent of advertising as a divided nation voted to give him more time. In defeating Mitt Romney, the president carried Colorado, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin, a near sweep of the battleground states, and was holding a narrow advantage in Florida. The path to victory for Mr. Romney narrowed as the night wore along, with Mr. Obama winning at least 303 electoral votes.</p>
         
        
          <p class="g-text historian">Many African-Americans argued that Mr. Obama’s second election was at least as crucial as his first, demonstrating that the first African-American president had not been a fluke. According to the president’s aide David Axelrod, when Mr. Romney telephoned to concede, he unwittingly annoyed the victor by saying, “You really did a great job of getting out the vote in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.” After the call, Mr. Obama privately told his circle, “In other words, black people. That’s what he thinks this was all about.”</p>
