<p><b>2013</b></p>
<p><b>June 18:</b> Trump<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347187059653476352" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>writes</u></a> on Twitter: “The Miss Universe Pageant will be broadcast live from MOSCOW, RUSSIA on November 9th. A big deal that will bring our countries together!”</p>
<p> Trump, who owned the pageant at the time,<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>adds</u></a> later that day: “Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?”</p>
<p><b>Oct. 17:</b> Trump<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR_SoJpWzOA" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>says in an interview with David Letterman</u></a> he has conducted “a lot of business with the Russians.”</p>
<p>“Well I’ve done a lot of business with the Russians,” Trump says. “They’re smart and they’re tough.” Trump goes on to say that Putin is a “tough guy” and that he’s met him “once.”</p><aside class="story-related no-border">

<p><b>Nov. 9: </b>The Miss Universe pageant is held in Moscow. Trump<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-russia-moscow-miss-universe-223173" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>attends</u></a>.</p>
<p><b>Nov. 10</b>: Trump<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/399729261684490240" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>writes</u></a> on Twitter: “I just got back from Russia-learned lots &amp; lots. Moscow is a very interesting and amazing place! U.S. MUST BE VERY SMART AND VERY STRATEGIC.”</p>
<p><b>2015</b></p>
<p><b>September:</b> An FBI agent<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>informs</u></a> a tech-support contractor at the Democratic National Committee that it may have been hacked. The contractor is not sure if the caller is really an FBI agent or if the call is legitimate.</p>
<p><b>Oct. 14:</b> Trump appears to cast doubt on the intelligence community’s assessment that Russian-backed separatists were behind the downing of civilian airliner, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. </p>
<p>&quot;That's a horrible thing that happened,” Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/14/politics/donald-trump-mh17-plane-russians/" target="_blank">says</a>. &quot;It's disgusting and disgraceful but Putin and Russia say they didn't do it, the other side said they did, no one really knows who did it, probably Putin knows who did it. Possibly it was Russia but they are totally denying it. … But they're saying it wasn't them. The other side says it is them. And we're going to go through that arguing for probably for 50 years and nobody is ever going to know. Probably was Russia.” </p><aside class="story-related no-border">

<p><b>Nov. 10:</b> Trump says at a GOP debate that he got to know Putin “very well because we were both on '60 Minutes,' we were stablemates, and we did very well that night.” He adds: “If Putin wants to go and knocked the hell out of ISIS, I am all for it, 100 percent, and I can’t understand how anybody would be against it.”</p>
<p><b>Dec. 10:</b> Michael Flynn<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/donald-trump-2016-russia-today-rt-kremlin-media-vladimir-putin-213833" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>attends</u></a> Russia Today’s 10th anniversary dinner. He participates in a paid speaking engagement and sits just two seats from Putin.</p>
<p><b>Dec. 17:</b> Russian President Vladimir Putin praises Trump, then the front-runner in the Republican primary, at his year-end news conference.</p>
<p> “He is a very flamboyant man, very talented, no doubt about that. But it’s not our business to judge his merits, it’s up to the voters of the United States,&quot; Putin<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/putin-says-welcomes-trumps-calls-deeper-ties-russia-123323669.html?ref=gs" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>says</u></a>. &quot;He is an absolute leader of the presidential race, as we see it today. He says that he wants to move to another level relations, a deeper level of relations with Russia … How can we not welcome that? Of course, we welcome it.”</p>
<p>Trump responds with praise of his own.</p>
<p>&quot;It is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond,&quot; Trump<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/trump-vladimir-putin-praise-216892" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>says</u></a> in a statement. &quot;I have always felt that Russia and the United States should be able to work well with each other towards defeating terrorism and restoring world peace, not to mention trade and all of the other benefits derived from mutual respect.&quot;</p>
<p><b>2016</b></p>
<p><b>Feb. 17</b>: “Putin called me a genius,” Trump says at a campaign event in South Carolina. According to<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/08/donald-trump/did-vladimir-putin-call-trump-brilliant/" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>PolitiFact</u></a>, Trump would repeat the claim “three times in April, in a May interview on CNN, at a June rally in California, twice in July, and at an August town hall in Ohio.”</p>
<p><b>March 6:</b> Around the time George Papadopoulos learns he will be a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, he has a conversation with a supervisory campaign official. Papadopoulos leaves the conversation with the understanding that “a principal foreign policy focus of the Campaign was an improved U.S. relationship with Russia,” according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif, serif, EmojiFont; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">a plea agreement</a>.</p>
<p><b>March 14:</b> Papadopoulos meets in Italy with a London-based professor who takes “great interest” in him after learning of his role in the Trump campaign, according to a plea agreement. Papadopoulos learns that the professor has “substantial connections with Russian government officials, which Papadopoulos thought could increase his importance as a policy advisor to the Campaign,” the plea agreement says.</p><aside class="story-related no-border">

<p><b>March 19:</b> John Podesta’s staff<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>is told incorrectly by another Clinton campaign staffer</u></a> that an email instructing him to change his password is legitimate. The action allows Russian hackers into Podesta’s account.</p>
<p><b>March 21:</b> When asked who his foreign policy advisers are (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/03/21/a-transcript-of-donald-trumps-meeting-with-the-washington-post-editorial-board/?utm_term=.22701fa004ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with The Washington Post</a>), Trump names, among others, Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, who he calls an “excellent guy.” Page is an American banker who had lived in Moscow for three years.</p>
<p><b>March 22:</b> Billy Rinehart, a former DNC employee working for the Clinton campaign,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>receives</u></a> what he thinks is a legitimate email telling him to change his password. He enters his information, unwittingly giving Russian hackers access to his account.</p>
<p><b>March 24:</b> Papadopoulos meets in London with the professor, who is accompanied by a female Russian national, who is introduced as someone “with connections to senior Russian government officials,” according to the plea agreement. Papadopoulos emails a campaign supervisor after the meeting, along with several members of the foreign policy team, and tells them he discussed arranging a meeting with Russian leadership “to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump.” The campaign supervisor responds, “Great work,” according to the plea agreement.<br /></p><aside class="story-related no-border">

<p><b>March 31:</b> Trump attends a meeting in Washington with foreign policy advisors, including Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos “stated, in sum and substance, that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin,” according to the plea agreement. </p>
<p>The White House later says it was the only meeting of the group to take place.</p>
<p>During his time in Washington, Papadopoulos worked with the professor and female Russian national to “arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government, and took steps to advise the Campaign of his progress,” according to the plea agreement. In early April, he sends multiple emails to campaign officials about his contacts with the Russians.</p>
<p><b>March 28:</b> Trump hires Paul Manafort to help lead his delegate-gathering efforts. Manafort had worked recently as a senior adviser for pro-Russia Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
<p><b>April 18:</b> The professor introduces Papadopoulos to an individual over email who Papadopoulos is told has connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Papadopoulos and the individual go on to have “multiple conversations over Skype and email about setting ‘the groundwork’ for a ‘potential’ meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials,” according to the plea deal.</p>
<p><b>April 25:</b> Papadopoulos emails a senior policy adviser to the Trump campaign and says, according to the plea deal: “The Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready []. The advantage of being in London is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in 'neutral' cities.” </p>
<p><b>April 26:</b> Papadopoulos meets the professor for breakfast at a London hotel. The professor says he has just returned from meeting with high-level Russian government officials in Moscow and that “he )the Professor) learned that that the Russians had obtained ‘dirt’ on then-candidate Clinton,” according to the plea deal. Papadopoulos would later tell the FBI that the professor also said the Russians had “emails of Clinton” and “they have thousands of emails.” </p>
<p><b>April 27:</b> Papadopoulos emails a high-ranking campaign official and writes, according to the plea agreement, that he would like “to discuss Russia's interest in hosting Mr. Trump. Have been receiving a lot of calls over the last month about Putin wanting to host him and the team when the time is right.” Papadopoulos also emails the senior policy advisor to say he has “some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.” </p>
<p>On the same day, Trump delivers his first major foreign policy address in Washington.</p><div class="story-interrupt pos-beta format-m ">

<p>He calls for better relations with Russia in the speech: “We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests. Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia, from a position of strength only, is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries. Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can’t make a deal under my administration, a deal that’s great — not good, great — for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It’s as simple as that. We’re going to find out.”</p>
<p>Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak is seated in the front row.</p>
<p><b>May 4:</b> Papadopoulos receives an email from individual with connections to the foreign affairs ministry, who says his colleagues are “open for cooperation” and offers to set up a meeting in Moscow. Papadopoulos forwards the email to a high-ranking campaign official, and asks: “What do you think? Is this something we want to move forward with?” according to the plea deal.</p>
<p><b>May 5:</b> Papadopoulos and the campaign supervisor have a phone call, after which Papadopoulos forwards him the email from the Russian foreign affairs contact.</p>
<p><b>May 14:</b> Papadopoulos reiterates in an email to a high-ranking campaign official that the Russian government is “interested in hosting Mr. Trump.” </p>

<p>“The FBI will get to the bottom of who is behind the hacking,” Pence said. “If it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences.” But he went on to say there should be increased focus on the contents of the hacks and what they exposed about the Democratic Party.</p>

<p><b>Oct. 4</b>: Julian Assange makes a 3 a.m. EST announcement via video saying WikiLeaks will publish new information on the presidential election “every week for the next 10 weeks.”</p>
<p><b>Oct. 7:</b> WikiLeaks<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/john-podesta-wikileaks-hacked-emails-229304" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>dumped a trove</u></a> of emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s personal email account. The release came just hours after a tape emerged in which Trump bragged about groping women by the genitals. The emails were widely covered in the American media, and the Republican National Committee touted them as evidence of “who Hillary Clinton really is.”</p>
<p>The Obama administration<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obama-administration-accuses-russian-government-of-election-year-hacking-229296" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> <u>accuses Russia</u></a> of deploying hackers to interfere in the presidential election. A statement from Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, says hacked documents posted on DC Leaks, Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks appear linked to Russian intelligence and accuses “Russia’s senior-most officials” of directing the hacks.</p>
<p><b>Oct. 9:</b> Trump cites WikiLeaks in the second presidential debate to accuse the DNC of rigging the Democratic primary against Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton is also asked at the debate about purported excerpts from a paid speech she gave released by WikiLeaks.</p>
<p> Clinton responds, in part: “But, you know, let’s talk about what’s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don’t even know if it’s accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected. They’re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.”</p>
<p> “She doesn’t know if it’s the Russians doing the hacking,” Trump responds. “Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know — I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don’t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.”</p>
<p><b>Oct. 10:</b> “I love WikiLeaks,” Trump says at a Pennsylvania rally. He specifically cites some of the hacked emails to attack Clinton.</p><div class="story-interrupt pos-alpha format-m ">

<p>“I think it’s a reasonable assumption to — or at least a reasonable conclusion — that Mr. Stone had advance warning and the Trump campaign had advance warning about what Assange was going to do,” Podesta <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/12/is-there-actually-evidence-that-trump-allies-had-a-heads-up-on-what-wikileaks-was-doing/?utm_term=.041a43822afb" target="_blank">tells</a> reporters, referencing Trump friend and ally Roger Stone. </p>
<p><b>Oct. 12:</b> Stone <a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2016/10/12/trump-ally-roger-stone-admits-back-channel-tie-to-wikileaks/" target="_blank">tells</a> a Florida TV station that he has “back-channel communication” with Assange. </p>
<p>“I do have a back-channel communication with Assange, because we have a good mutual friend,” Stone says. “That friend travels back and forth from the United States to London and we talk. I had dinner with him last Monday.” </p>
<p>He denies ever having spoken to Assange himself, or having met with him.</p>
<p><b>Oct. 19: </b>At the third and final presidential debate, Clinton comments that Putin backed Trump because he “would rather have a puppet as president of the United States.”</p>
<p> “No puppet, no puppet, you’re the puppet,” Trump responds.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty clear you won’t admit that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race,” Clinton replies.</p>

<p><b>Nov. 18:</b> Trump names Michael Flynn as his national security adviser.</p>
<p><b>Nov. 28:</b> In an interview with Time magazine, Trump continues to express doubt that Russia attempted to interfere in the election. He says: “I don’t believe they interfered. That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say, ‘Oh, Russia interfered.’ Why not get along with Russia? And they can help us fight ISIS, which is both costly in lives and costly in money. And they’re effective and smart. It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey. I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals.”</p>

<p><b>Jan. 5:</b> Obama is briefed on the intelligence community’s findings on Russian interference in the election.</p>
<p><b>Jan. 6</b>: Briefings begin with lawmakers on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.</p>
<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence releases an unclassified report expressing the conclusion of the CIA, FBI and NSA about Russian election interference: “We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments. We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.”</p>
<p>The report concludes that DC Leaks, Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks all obtained the hacked documents via Russian government-backed hackers.</p>
<p>That same day, Clapper, FBI director James Comey and CIA director John Brennan brief Trump at Trump Tower on the intelligence community’s findings.</p>

<p>At a news conference at Trump Tower, Trump calls the reports “fake news” but also says for the first time that he believes the election-related hacks were conducted by Russia. But he is quick to add: “And I have to say this also, the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job.”</p>
<p>Trump also says during the news conference: “If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia. Russia can help us fight ISIS, which, by the way, is, No. 1, tricky. I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed. If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That’s called an asset, not a liability. Now, I don’t know that I’m gonna get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do.”</p>
<p>Also at the news conference, incoming press secretary Sean Spicer calls the BuzzFeed report “highly salacious and flat-out false” and called BuzzFeed’s and CNN’s reporting “a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks.” Incoming Vice President Mike Pence labels the reports “fake news,” and accused certain media outlets of an “attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration.”</p>

<p>Trump posts an old picture of Sen.

A total hypocrite!”</p>
<p>Trump later tweets an article about Nancy Pelosi having met with Kislyak, who she said she hadn’t met, and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837770149767827456" target="_blank">writes</a>: “I hereby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it.” </p>

<p><b>March 4:</b> Trump accuses Obama of having ordered a tapping of the phones at Trump Tower during the campaign, writing in a <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106" target="_blank">series</a> of tweets: “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my &quot;wires tapped&quot; in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! … Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone. … Is it legal for a sitting President to be &quot;wire tapping&quot; a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! … I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! … How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!” </p>
<p>Obama denied the allegations through a spokesman. Comey asks the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/us/politics/trump-seeks-inquiry-into-allegations-that-obama-tapped-his-phones.html" target="_blank">to reject the claim,</a> but no rejection is issued. The claims appeared to be based on a talk radio segment and <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/mark-levin-obama-used-police-state-tactics-undermine-trump/" target="_blank">a Breitbart article</a> about the talk radio segment. The White House declines to offer any evidence to back up the claims, and the next day calls on Congress to investigate and says it will not comment further.</p>
<p>Trump ally Roger Stone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/05/roger-stone-trump-adviser-julian-assange" target="_blank">writes</a> on Twitter that he “never denied perfectly legal backchannel to Assange who indeed had the goods on #CrookedHillary.” </p>

<p><b>March 8:</b> When asked if Trump is the target of a counter-intelligence investigation, Spicer responds: “I think that’s what we need to find out.” He later <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/08/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer" target="_blank">says</a>: “There is no reason to believe that he is the target of any investigation.” </p>
<p><b>March 9:</b> When asked if Trump agrees with Sen. Ben Sasse’s declaration that Assange belongs in jail, Spicer demurs and suggests reporters speak with the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>“The FBI, as part of our counterintelligence effort, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 president election,” Comey declares.</p>
<p>Trump writes on Twitter: “James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it! … The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College &amp; lost! … The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now! … What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?” </p>
<p><b>March 22:</b> The Associated Press <a href="https://www.apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a" target="_blank">reports</a> that Manafort previously secretly worked on behalf of a Russian billionaire to enhance the image of Putin and the Russian government in the West.</p>
<p>At the White House, Spicer downplays Manafort’s role in the campaign and declares: “And to be clear, the president has no personal financial dealings with Russia. His ties are limited to hosting a contest in Russia once, and selling a Palm Beach home to a businessman in 2005. That's it.” </p>
<p>When asked if Manafort ever encouraged the campaign to take a more pro-Russia position, Spicer responds: “Not that I’m aware of.” </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/22/politics/us-officials-info-suggests-trump-associates-may-have-coordinated-with-russians/" target="_blank">CNN reports that night:</a> “The FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign, US officials told CNN. This is partly what FBI Director James Comey was referring to when he made a bombshell announcement Monday before Congress that the FBI is investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, according to one source.” </p>
<p><b>March 23:</b> Spicer mocks the CNN report, saying the use of the term “associates” is too broad.</p>
<p>Trump writes on Twitter: “Just watched the totally biased and fake news reports of the so-called Russia story on NBC and ABC. Such dishonesty!” </p>
<p><b>March 27:</b> Spicer reads a State Department statement condemning Russia’s detention of peaceful protesters the previous day. </p>
<p>“The United States will monitor the situation, and we call on the government of Russia to immediately release all peaceful protestors,” Spicer says.</p>
<p>Trump writes on Twitter: “Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!” He also questions why people do not focus on whether Hillary Clinton has ties to Russia.</p>
<p><b>March 31:</b> Trump writes on Twitter: “Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media &amp; Dems, of historic proportion!”</p>
<p><b>April 1:</b> Trump writes on Twitter: “When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story? … It is the same Fake News Media that said there is &quot;no path to victory for Trump&quot; that is now pushing the phony Russia story.

<p>That night, Trump <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/syria-air-strikes-trump-us-236974" target="_blank">orders air strikes</a> against Syrian forces following the chemical weapons attack. Russia denounced the strikes.</p>
<p><b>April 13:</b> “We’re not getting along with Russia at all … we may be at an all-time low,” Trump says during a press conference at the White House with the NATO secretary general. Tillerson and Putin met the same day in Moscow.</p>

<p><b>April 25:</b> The Senate <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/25/rosenstein-confirmed-attorney-general-237600" target="_blank">votes 94-6</a> to confirm Rod Rosenstein as deputy attorney general.</p>
<p><b>May 2:</b> Trump writes on Twitter: “FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony......Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?”</p>

<p>Yates confirms that she informed the White House that Flynn was “compromised” weeks before news broke that Flynn had misled the vice president and was fired.</p>
<p>Trump tweets: “Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ‘no evidence’ of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.” </p>
<p>Trump later tweets: “The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?” </p>
<p><b>May 9:</b> Trump fires FBI Director James Comey. In the letter announcing his termination, Trump writes: “While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.” </p>
<p>The White House’s official explanation is that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommended the termination in a memo dated May 9, and Sessions affirmed the recommendation in a letter to Trump.</p>
<p>The firing leads to outcry among Democrats and Republicans alike, with many renewing calls for an independent investigation into potential collusion between Trump’s campaign and the Russian government.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who joined Trump for the first meeting, says Trump pressed Putin on election meddling and that the Russian leader repeated his past denials. Trump &quot;pressed him and then felt like, at this point, let’s talk about how do we go forward?” Tillerson said.</p>
<p><b>July 8:</b> The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html" target="_blank">breaks</a> the story about Donald Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer. Trump Jr. provided the Times with a statement that the meeting was about an adoption program.</p>
<p>It is later <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-dictated-sons-misleading-statement-on-meeting-with-russian-lawyer/2017/07/31/04c94f96-73ae-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html?utm_term=.15a84608e795" target="_blank">revealed by the Washington Post</a> that Trump himself dictated the statement on the flight home from the G20 meeting.</p>
<p><b>July 9: </b>Trump opens the day with a series of tweets: “I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I've already given my opinion…. We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia! … Putin &amp; I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, &amp; many other negative things, will be guarded.... Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?… Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin.

<p>Trump Jr. releases a statement about his meeting with June 2016 Veselnitskaya, saying she had arrived offering &quot;information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton.&quot; But, he continues: &quot;Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information. She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.&quot;</p>
<p><b>July 10:</b> The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-email-candidacy.html" target="_blank">reports</a> that Trump Jr. was informed in an email that the information he would be provided at the meeting was part of the Russian government's effort to support Trump's candidacy.</p>
<p>Trump Jr.'s lawyer, Alan Futerfas, tells the Times in a statement that &quot;Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed.&quot;</p>
<p><b>July 11: </b>Moments before The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/trump-russia-email-clinton.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">published</a> portions of Trump Jr.'s emails arranging the meeting, Trump Jr. himself tweets out the emails. In the emails, Goldstone promised &quot;information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.&quot; The information, Goldstone noted, &quot;is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it is what you say I love it especially later in the summer,&quot; Trump Jr. replied.</p>
<p>That evening, Trump Jr. goes on Sean Hannity's program on Fox News. He tells Hannity the meeting was “such a nothing,” but that &quot;In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.”</p>
<p>Pence's office releases a statement saying Pence is &quot;not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket.&quot;</p>
<p><b>July 12:</b> Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, tells CNN that neither he nor Trump were &quot;involved in the statement drafting at all&quot; for the July 8 statement which said the meeting had been about adoption.</p>
<p>Pence's press secretary, Marc Lotter, was asked three times on Fox News if Pence had met with any officials associated with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign. He declined to answer.</p>
<p><b>July 13: </b>Lotter <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/13/mike-pence-no-russia-meeting-during-2016-election-240504" target="_blank">releases a statement</a> saying, “The Vice President had no meetings with any individual associated with the Russian government during the campaign or transition.&quot;</p>
<p><b>July 15:</b> Trump writes on Twitter: &quot;Stock Market hit another all-time high yesterday - despite the Russian hoax story! Also, jobs numbers are starting to look very good!&quot;</p>
<p><b>July 16:</b> Sekulow repeats his insistence that Trump was not involved in preparing the original statement.</p>
<p>&quot;I do want to be clear -- that the President was not involved in the drafting of the statement,&quot; he told NBC's Chuck Todd.</p>
<p><b>July 18:</b> The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/world/europe/trump-putin-undisclosed-meeting.html?mcubz=1" target="_blank">reveals</a> Trump's and Putin's undisclosed conversation over dinner, for which only a Russian government translator was present. Trump responds on Twitter: &quot;Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is 'sick.' All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!&quot; He later added: &quot;The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!&quot;</p>
<p><b>July 19:</b> The White House further downplays the July 7 dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that once again the Russia fever has caught up with the media,&quot; White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tells reporters. &quot;It was a brief conversation, and certainly not an hour,&quot; Sanders later adds, but quips that she was not following Trump around &quot;with a stopwatch.&quot;</p>
<p>Trump tells the New York Times he regrets appointing Jeff Sessions as Attorney General and calls Sessions’s recusal in the Russia probe &quot;very unfair to the president.&quot; Trump also contends that Comey only shared the famous dossier with him to gain leverage.</p>
<p><b>July 20:</b> The spokesman for Trump's outside legal team, Mark Corallo, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/20/spokesman-for-trumps-legal-team-resigns-just-two-months-after-starting-240783" target="_blank">leaves his post</a> after less than two months in the job.</p>

<p><b>July 22:</b> Trump writes on Twitter: &quot;While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS.... My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media &amp; authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (&amp; acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!&quot;</p>
<p><b>July 23: </b>Trump writes on Twitter: &quot;As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!... It's very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President.&quot;</p>
<p><b>July 24:</b> Trump writes on Twitter: &quot;After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that 'Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia.'” (&quot;People didn’t know what we stood for [in 2016], just that we were against Trump,” Schumer had told the Washington Post.)</p><div class="story-interrupt pos-alpha format-s ">

<p>Kushner testifies behind closed doors before the Senate Intelligence Committee.&quot;I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so,” he tells reporters.</p>
<p>Trump continues to harangue Sessions on Twitter, and also also takes aim at the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff: &quot;So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes &amp; Russia relations?” Trump tweets, adding: “Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into ‘Russia,’ spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!&quot;</p>
<p><b>July 25:</b> Trump writes on Twitter: “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign – ‘quietly working to boost Clinton.’ So where is the investigation A.G. ... Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails &amp; DNC server) &amp; Intel leakers! ... Problem is that the acting head of the FBI &amp; the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!&quot;</p>
<p>The House passes sanctions on Russia by a vote of 419-3. The package was designed as retribution for Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and limits Trump’s ability to unilaterally relax existing sanctions on Moscow.</p>
