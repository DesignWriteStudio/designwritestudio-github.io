  abstract  = {THE KINDS OF FILE structures required if we are to use the computer for personal files and as an adjunct to creativity are wholly different in character from those customary in business and scientific data processing. They need to provide the capacity for intricate and idiosyncratic arrangements, total modifiability, undecided alternatives, and thorough internal documentation. I want to explain how some ideas developed and what they are. The original problem was to specify a computer system for personal information retrieval and documentation, able to do some rather complicated things in clear and simple ways. In this paper I will explain the original problem. Then I will explain why the problem is not simple, and why the solution (a file structure) must yet be very simple. The file structure suggested here is the Evolutionary List File, to be built of zippered lists. A number of uses will be suggested for such a file, to show the breadth of its potential usefulness. Finally, I want to explain the philosophical implications of this approach for information retrieval and data structure in a changing world.},

However, in the field of scholarly writing research, several studies discuss the need for improving the current state of affairs [18][24][29]. This research aimed to investigate whether typed and/or bi-directional links have an effect on users' performance and confidence when undertaking a literature survey [18], considered one of the phases of a scholarly writing process [29]. Two empirical studies were conducted - a survey and a formal experiment, and results showed that both typed and bi-directional links had significant effect on users' performance and confidence when undertaking common early scholarly writing tasks, specifically benefiting tasks relating to surveying existing literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents our approach of using hypertext representations to support a scholar in the early stages of a scholarly writing process. We take D. A. Schoen's model of design as a theoretical framework. Schoen views design as a reflective conversation with the materials of a situation, where the designer interacts with the materials, such as pen and sketch on a sheet of paper, in the reflection-in-action process. The designer acts and reflects almost simultaneously; acting on external representations, interpreting emerging representations, and reacting to them. We argue that a scholar needs to engage in two different types of representations in the reflection-in-action process: external representations for thinking about the problem, and representations for expressing a solution in a publishable form. The former does not necessarily precede the latter; rather, the two representations coevolve through the reflection-in-action process. Our approach uses hypertext representations as a means to interact with in the early stages of scholarly writing both for thinking about the problem and for expressing a solution. Hypertext representations have long been studied in their relation to supporting human intellectual work; our approach, however, is unique in providing the two representations with a specific concern for supporting reflection-in-action by applying the concept called {ART} (Amplifying Representational Talkback) as an interaction design principle. Based on this framework, we have developed {ART}014, a tool for scholarly writing. {ART}014 simultaneously supports two types of hypertext representations: a column-based network hypertext representation and a spatial hypertext representation. The two representations are located side by side, and integrated when an interaction with one representation is reflected in the visual presentation of the other. Although a user operates on the same set of objects through the two representations, the user expresses relationships among the objects independently in the two representations. We present a scenario to illustrate in detail how the design concepts underpinning {ART}014 supports scholarly writing. This paper then discusses our approach from three viewpoints by using the scenario: use of the two representations, engagement in reflection-in-action, and modes of authoring. The paper concludes with a description of future directions.},

It argues for the necessity of an interactive scholarly communication research agenda by briefly reviewing the rapid development of alternative authoring and publishing models. Seven dimensions of interactive communication that delineate a design space for the area are described. Previous work and existing new media are used to initially populate the design space and show opportunities for new research directions. {VKB} spaces, Synchrony {PADLs}, and Walden's paths are used as foils for describing new media for interactive scholarly communication. This leads to a brief discussion of uncovered areas in the design space and open research questions. A community developed framework for future interactive scholarly communications would be a major contribution and is put forth as the overall goal.},

Reflecting on the full history of the written word, Vandendorpe provides a clear overview of how materiality makes a difference in the creation and interpretation of texts. Surveying the conventions of reading andwriting that have appeared and disappeared in the Internet's wake, Vandendorpe considers various forms of organization, textual design, the use (and distrust) of illustrations, and styles of reference and annotation. He also examines the novel componentsof digital texts, including hyperlinks and emoticons, and looks at emergent, collaborative genres such as blogs and wikis, which blur the distinction between author and reader. Looking to the future, reading and writing will continue to evolve based on the current, contested trends of universal digitization and accessibility." -- Back cover.},
